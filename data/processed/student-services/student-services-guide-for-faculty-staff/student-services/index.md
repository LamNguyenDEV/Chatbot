University Bookstore

* **Telephone:** 973-655-4310
* **Location:** Student Center Annex, 1st Floor
* [University Bookstore Website](http://www.bkstr.com/montclairstatestore/home)

The University bookstore is your one stop shopping source for “things you need-stuff you want.” Books, apparel, gifts, gift cards, computer products, dorm and school supplies are offered. Campus reseller for Apple computer.

### How can the bookstore help you as a faculty member?

Whether it’s submitting what textbook you’re adopting next semester, reviewing peer critiques of a potential textbook selection, adding course-pack materials, the University Bookstore has a tremendous offering of products and services for you.

### How can faculty save the students money?

If you turn in your adoptions before or by the deadline, the Bookstore can get a head start on shopping for used textbooks and can plan buyback accordingly. Used books save students lots of money. With readopting books, we can keep the flow of used books circulating on our campus and pay the maximum value at buyback.

### What are the concerns with custom bundles or books?

With custom bundles and books, there is normally a slower turn-around time in getting the order in and publishers usually do not allow the bookstores to return them. Reorders are usually the biggest problem since publishers do not usually keep custom products in stock. Other concerns include refund issues. Most bundles do not qualify for Buyback.

### If I know what textbook I am using for several semesters in advance, should I let the Bookstore know? Why?

Yes. This may save students money because we can buy back more books from students during Book Buyback and can better plan for used book purchases and returns.

### Who should I contact if I need to speak to someone about my textbook adoption?

You may call 973-655-7391.
