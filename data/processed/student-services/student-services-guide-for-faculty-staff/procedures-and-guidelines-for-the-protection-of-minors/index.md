## 1. Mandatory Reporting of Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect

### Policy Statement

Pursuant to [N.J.S.A. 9:6-8.10](https://www.nj.gov/dcf/reporting/how/), all persons are required by law to report suspected child abuse\* or neglect\*\*. Anyone who suspects that a minor has been subjected to physical, emotional or sexual abuse, abandonment, cruelty or neglect must immediately notify the Montclair State University Police Department (“MSUPD”) at 973-655-5222. Any person who has reasonable cause to believe that a minor has been subject to abuse or neglect is required by state law to report it to the New Jersey Department of Children and Families’ hotline by calling 1-877-NJABUSE (1-877-652-2873). Montclair State University will not retaliate against anyone who reports a reasonable belief that a minor has been subject to abuse or neglect.

### Procedures and Guidelines

New Jersey law defines abuse and neglect as:

1. **Abuse** is the physical, sexual or emotional harm or risk of harm to a child under the age of 18 caused by a parent or other person who acts as a caregiver for the child.
2. **Neglect** occurs when a parent or caregiver fails to provide proper supervision for a child or willfully fails to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, education or medical care.

Any reports made to the MSUPD will be reported by MSUPD to the State hotline and coordinated with other legal authorities.

If the suspected abuse concerns a Montclair State University employee, the Vice President for Human Resources must also be notified, at 973-655-4227. The Vice President for Human Resources should also refer the matter to the University’s Title IX Coordinator for investigation.

If the suspected abuse concerns a Montclair State University student, the Dean of Students must also be notified, at 973-655-7548. The Dean of Students should also refer the report to the Deputy Title IX Coordinator for investigation.

## 2. Criminal History Background Checks & Self-Disclosure Reporting

### Policy Statement

Background Investigation and self-disclosure forms are required for all individuals who will have direct contact with minors including University employees and students, temporary workers, and volunteers. Background Investigations must be completed before any contact with a minor may commence, and must be repeated every 5 years. Third Party Entities must also perform background investigations upon individuals before having contact with minors, and verify such individuals are not subject to a background check report containing adverse information. If the Third-Party Entity’s background investigation indicates a record of sexually based offenses, crimes against minors, child abuse or any other adverse information, the Third-Party Entity shall exclude such individuals from participation in the program immediately, and report the information to University Police. The Third-Party Entity shall retain background check reports in accordance with all applicable laws.

### Procedures and Guidelines

Human Resources is responsible for administering background investigations for all individuals associated with University Sponsored Programs (including permanent and temporary employees, adjuncts, volunteers, and students) in compliance with applicable laws, University policy and applicable collective bargaining agreements. Background checks should not be viewed by or shared with others. Background check reports will be reviewed under the auspices of and at the direction of Human Resources alone. Any Sponsoring Unit that receives the results of a background check report shall not open or review the results and must immediately forward the report to Human Resources.

If the Sponsoring Unit’s background investigation reveals any adverse information other than sexually based offenses, child abuse or crimes against minors, Human Resources will notify the head of the Sponsoring Unit, Risk Management, University Police, and University Counsel to determine whether participation in the program by that individual is permissible, and in compliance with relevant federal and state statutes and regulations.

As required on the University’s self-disclosure form, if an individual participating in a University Sponsored program who has direct contact with a minor is charged with a sexually based offense or crime against a minor after they have commenced participation in the program, they shall be required to disclose this information in writing to Human Resources immediately upon being charged. Upon notification, Human Resources shall contact the Director of the program to restrict the individual from further participation in the program, unless otherwise notified by Human Resources. The University will assess the circumstances surrounding the charge, timeframe, nature, gravity and relevancy within the context of the job duties. The individual’s failure to notify Human Resources of a sexually based offense or crime against a minor under this section shall disqualify the individual from further participation in any University Sponsored Program.

## 3. Expectations for Conduct with Minors

### Policy Statement

Sponsoring units and Third-Party Entities must provide to staff, participants and parents/legal guardians, the University’s expectations regarding conduct with minors.

Individuals who have direct contact with minors, and minors themselves, may not engage in the following conduct:

1. Intoxication, use or possession of alcohol, marijuana (whether medicinal or recreational), synthetic marijuana, illegal drugs, tobacco or vaping products
2. Use or possession of fireworks, guns, knives and other weapons
3. Allowing, encouraging or performing any action that can reasonably be considered as abusive toward, or in the presence of a minor, including but not limited to verbal, emotional, physical or sexual abuse, harassment, bullying, cyber bullying, striking, hitting, poking, punching, spanking, restraining, and/or corporal punishment
4.

8. Viewing, sharing, providing or assisting to provide access to sexually explicit material
9. Giving gifts to and accepting gifts from any minor or their families
10. Meeting with minors outside of established times or locations for program activities
11. Neglecting the health or welfare of a child

### Procedures and Guidelines

Photographs, video, digital recording, and any other means of recording a minor in any manner may only take place if the minor’s parent or legal guardian has provided written permission in advance.

If this policy is alleged to have been violated, the Sponsoring Unit or Third-Party Entity must remove the individual in violation from further participation in the program, and may terminate the program. If the individual is a University employee, the violation must be reported to the Vice President for Human Resources. If the individual is a University volunteer, the violation must be reported to University Police for further investigation. If the individual is a University student, the violation must be reported to the Dean of Students. Complaints alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment may also be reported to the University Title IX Coordinator in accordance with the University’s Title IX Sexual Harassment/Sexual Assault Policy and Procedures.

## 4. Training

### Policy Statement

Prior to the first day of a program, individuals serving in Trained Adult and Trained Assistant roles must successfully complete required training and receive written guidelines/instructions regarding measures to prevent abuse of minors and duty to report suspected child abuse and neglect; measures to maintain adequate supervision and prevent injury; measures to address medical needs, medication administration, immunizations and communicable diseases; and measures to address emergency situations involving minors

### Procedures and Guidelines

Prior to the start of a program, Sponsoring Units and Third-Party Entities are expected to provide training for program staff (Trained Adults and Assistants) regarding the University’s conduct expectations when interacting with Minors, incident response protocols and duties in the event of an emergency, and minor protection rules and procedures as identified in this policy.

Montclair State University student Emergency Medical Technicians may provide this training to students who wish to serve as medication administrators.

## 5. Supervision and Facilities

### Policy Statement

Sponsoring Units must adopt and implement rules for proper supervision of minors by two or more trained staff in accordance with minimum staffing and supervision guidelines contained in procedures and guidelines, from time of arrival to departure. One-on-One Contact with minors is prohibited unless it is integral and essential to the methodology of the program (e.g. a private music lesson or individual psychotherapy counseling session) and with additional reasonable and appropriate measures for transparency and minor protection. Bathroom facilities must be provided for programs that operate for 4 hours or more. Supervision rules must include plans to address usage in specific types of facilities, illness and medication administration, and weather conditions. Hydration and adequate weather protection measures must be readily available and accessible at all times.

### Procedures and Guidelines

1. **Minimum Staffing**   
   The University requires Sponsoring Units and Third Party Entities to provide Trained Adults, Trained Assistants and Medication Administrators, as defined by the Policy in accordance with the following minimum staffing guidelines:
   1. Unless the Institutional Review Board has approved a specific research condition permitting a research activity with two (2) Trained Assistants when a Trained Adult is not present, minors must be supervised by at least two or more Authorized Adults aged 18 or older, at all times. See page 9 for supervision requirements during residential stays.
   2. To the greatest extent possible, all interactions with minors should occur in a public environment with two Authorized Adults present. Sufficient staffing must be provided to monitor and prevent situations in which actions can be misconstrued or provide opportunity to manipulate a minor (e.g. being alone with the last child to leave a class).
   3. When a Medication Administrator is required (overnight programs, programs involving more than minimal recreational activities, and programs involving minors with disabilities that have requested reasonable accommodations), the administrator must be identified prior to the first day of the program, and must be available on site at all times during the program.
   4. Unless laws applicable to the Sponsoring Unit or program require greater staffing ratios, Sponsoring Units and Third Party Entities must provide staff at the following minimal ratios identified by the American Camp Association standards:  

      |  | **Residential Programs** | **Day Time Programs** | **In Vehicles** |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | **Ages 4-5** | 1 staff/5 participants | 1 staff/6 participants | 1 staff/7 participants |
      | **Ages 6-8** | 1 staff/6 participants | 1 staff/8 participants | 1 staff/10 participants |
      | **Ages 9-14** | 1 staff/10 participants | 1 staff/10 participants | 1 staff/10 participants |

2. **Supervision Standards**  
   Minors are prohibited from access to restricted areas in University facilities, such as storage rooms, closets, kitchens, and private offices.
   1. **Arrival, Departure, Check-In and Check-Out.**  
      Minor participants must be supervised from arrival to departure, and shall only enter and exit from the curbside of a bus or vehicle.Arrival and departure from the University’s campus must be coordinated with and approved by University Police at least two weeks prior to the start of a program. The Sponsoring Unit is responsible for paying any costs associated with traffic management as determined by University Police.The Sponsoring Unit or Third-Party Entity must provide clear written instructions to parents and staff regarding daily drop off, pick up, program check in and program check out, which must include, at a minimum, locations for drop off, pick up, and program check-in and out, times for arrival and departure, and staffing, supervision and traffic control at drop off and pick up locations.Minors are not permitted to leave a program prior to its conclusion. Express written parental permission is required for a minor to depart campus unaccompanied at the end of a program. Only the parent, legal guardian, or other person whom the parent or legal guardian has designated in writing, may pick up or drop off a minor.
   2. **Locker Rooms, Dressing Rooms and Bathrooms**   
      The Sponsoring Unit or Third-Party Entity shall provide bathroom facilities for programs that operate for 4 hours or more. The Sponsoring Unit shall be responsible for paying the cost of temporary bathroom facilities, and any other third-party costs incurred by the University to ensure safe use of University facilities for the program. The Third-Party Entity shall pay a fee to the University for use of its facilities that includes the cost of such maintenance, and shall be responsible for all other costs for delivery of the program.It is prohibited for adults and minors to use bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, changing rooms and similar facilities at the same time. The Sponsoring Unit and Third-Party Entity are responsible for scheduling the use of such facilities to ensure that they are not used by adults and minors at the same time, and to separate minors by gender and, to the extent possible, by age. Prior to entering a multiple stall restroom or locker room facility that is open to the general public, a Trained Adult or Trained Assistant must determine it is vacant before entering with minors. A Trained Adult or Trained Assistant must wait outside the restroom door, and/or to adhere a temporary sign to the exterior restroom door indicating the space is currently in use by minors, and direct adults to proceed to another restroom or to wait until the minor exits before entering.A Trained Adult and at least one Trained Assistant will supervise minors while using locker rooms, dressing rooms and bathroom facilities. When minors are using enclosed stall changing rooms or locker room facilities, a minimum of two Trained Assistants shall be stationed in a main corridor of the bathroom facility, while minors change clothes in a wing or stall.Trained Adults and Trained Staff are prohibited from entering individual bathroom or shower stalls with minors and assisting minors with bathroom use, and are prohibited from assisting minors with changing clothes in locker room wings. Should a minor require any assistance while in a bathroom or shower stall or while changing clothes in a locker room, the Trained Assistant will notify the Trained Adult who will notify the minor’s parent or legal guardian. If the minor’s parent or legal guardian is unavailable to assist the minor, the Trained Assistant may assist the minor under the supervision of the Trained Adult or another Trained Assistant.
   3. **Outside/Weather**  
      The Sponsoring Unit and Third-Party Entity are responsible for identifying a fully enclosed shelter in advance, training staff on response protocols, and throughout the duration of the program, monitoring weather conditions, mitigating exposure to minors, determining when postponement or cancellation of outdoor activities due to weather is necessary. Weather postponements and cancellations will be made in accordance with the protocols of the National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA). University police may also issue advisories over the University’s public address system in the event of severe weather requiring individuals to take shelter.
      1. Heat – Authorized Adults must be trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of heat-related illnesses and how to treat them. Programs that occur out-of-doors in warm weather must provide ample water for all participants on site, and must provide regular breaks for participants to hydrate. Lightweight, loose fitting clothing, and use of sunscreen by participants should be strongly encouraged. In extreme heat events or heat waves (when the temperature reaches extremely high levels or when the combination of heat and humidity causes the air to become oppressive) programs must modify activities to mitigate heat exposure to the extent possible. Modifications may include:
         * Moving activities into air-conditioned facilities during the hottest hours of the day
         * Avoiding unnecessary strenuous exercise and physical activities outdoors
         * Providing shady areas so that your body has a chance to recover.
         * Limiting outdoor activity to when it’s coolest, during early morning and evening hours
         * Postponing or cancelling the program.
      2. Lightning – When thunderstorms are producing lightning and approaching the immediate location, and when the distance between the edge of the lightning storm and the location of the outdoor activity reaches 6 miles, activities should be suspended until 30 minutes after the last strike of lightning is seen and after the last sound of thunder is heard. This 30 minute clock restarts for each lightning flash and each time thunder is heard.
   4. **Water Areas & Swimming Pools**  
      Programs may occur at swimming areas or pool facilities owned by the University. Programs may not occur at swimming areas or pool facilities that are not owned by or operated by the University. If a program uses a swimming pool, lake or beach area, the Sponsoring Unit must provide a lifeguard who is at least 16 years of age, and a lifeguard supervisor who is at least 18 years of age, to attend and supervise each non-instructional swimming program in accordance with these ratios:
      * One lifeguard and lifeguard supervisor when there are 30 or fewer minors in the water during non-instructional swimming.
      * One lifeguard and 2 Trained Assistants when there are 30 or fewer minors in the water during instructional swimming.
      * One additional lifeguard for every additional 30 minors or fraction thereof in the water.
      * One lifeguard and 2 Trained Assistants shall be provided for every 20 or fewer minors in the water, if the swimming area has a maximum depth of 36 inches and a maximum swimming area of 500 feet. For every additional 20 minors or a fraction thereof, in such a body of water, one additional lifeguard will be provided.

      The Sponsoring Unit must also confirm that the individual assigned to act as lifeguard possesses a lifeguard supervisor certification by an agency approved and recognized by the State of New Jersey Department of Health. The Sponsoring Unit may accept the recognized certifications listed in Procedure 17 (NJ Youth Camp Safety Standards N.J.A.C. 8:25-9.2) or other applicable laws. The lifeguard certification shall be appropriate to the level of training and supervision necessary for his/her position.

      The Sponsoring Unit must also designate areas for non-swimmers, beginners and swimmers, as appropriate. The Sponsoring Unit through its lifeguard and Trained Adults, must assess the swimming ability of each minor and classify each minor as a non-swimmer, beginner or swimmer, or classify all minors as non-swimmers. The Sponsoring Unit shall ensure that minors are confined to swimming areas commensurate with the limits of their swimming ability or in swimming areas which require lesser skills for which they have been classified. In order to classify a minor as a swimmer, the minor must be able to: 1) jump feet first into water which is over his/her head and come to the surface; 2) swim a distance of 25 feet and change direction using different strokes; and 3) swim another distance of 25 feet, stop and float or tread water for 1 minute.

      The Sponsoring Unit must establish and implement a system for tracking swimmers (buddy, colored cap, combination thereof). The lifeguard and Trained Assistants shall conduct minor checks at least every 10 minutes during swimming periods. The Sponsoring Unit must develop and institute a written lost swimmer plan, which includes, at a minimum: 1) all responsibilities and duties in the event of an emergency; and 2) the requirement that a lost swimmer drill be held and documented at least once every 2 weeks.
   5. **Residence Hall Rooms & Sleeping Quarters**  
      When overnight accommodations are part of the program, the Sponsoring Unit or Third Party must adopt and implement rules and regulations for proper supervision of minors in housing, including:
      * Assign at least two Trained Adults to be present within the housing unit and accessible at all times.
      * Ensure that sleeping accommodations for adults are separated from sleeping accommodations provided to minors, unless the adult is the minor’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).
      * Ensure that male and female minors are not assigned to the same room unless they share the same parent or legal guardian who will accompany them.
      * Provide keys to a room assigned to a minor only to University employees whose job description requires they perform the duty of University Police, Residence Life, and Facilities management. Trained Adults, Trained Assistants, and Authorized Adults shall not be provided keys or key card access to rooms occupied by minors.
      * Refuse to permit a person to enter the sleeping quarters of a minor except in the event of an emergency.
      * In the event a maintenance or repair must be made within a sleeping or bathing area occupied by a minor, ensure the repair occurs when the minor is not present, or if the minor is present, to occur under the supervision of a Trained Assistant.
      * Provide the name of each minor, written signed permission provided by each minor’s parent or legal guardian that will reside in University Housing, the name and contact information for the minor’s parent or legal guardian in the event of an emergency, and a release of liability to the University signed by the parent or legal guardian of the minor.
      * Identify an age-appropriate curfew time for the minors.
      * Trained Adult(s) and Trained Assistant(s) from the Sponsoring Unit or Third-Party Entity must conduct door-to-door room checks/head counts in pairs, prior to lights out and curfew time and again in the morning before departing from the Residence Hall.
      * Take action to prohibit visitation by Minors, Trained Adults and Trained Assistants within rooms assigned to minors. Visitation may occur in other building areas open the public (e.g. lobbies and/or floor lounges) during approved hours specified by the Trained Adult.
      * Require program staff (Trained Adults or Assistants) to instruct minors on emergency exit procedures prior to accessing rooms.
      * Comply with all security measures as directed by Residence Life and University Police.
   6. **Restricted Access Areas**  
      Minors shall not be permitted to access certain areas or use certain equipment, including but not limited to the following:
      * Closets and equipment rooms, including Recreation Center fitness equipment and Panzer equipment rooms, which are to remain locked when minors are in attendance.
      * Residence hall kitchens, which are to be locked when minors are in residence.
      * Conference Center and dining area kitchens, which are to be locked when unoccupied.
      * Computer labs, except when such use is integral to the learning outcomes of the program, and under the supervision and usage policies prescribed by the Division of Information Technology.
      * Private offices, examination rooms, rehearsal rooms, and other closed door or private spaces, may only be utilized by minors with advanced notification to the head of the Sponsoring Unit responsible for the facility being used. Additional measures to ensure safety and visual transparency, should be reviewed and implemented as appropriate. Visual transparency measures may include:
        + installing two-way glass or glass panels in or around doors
        + ensuring that glass in doors and windows are not covered
        + keeping doors open
        + installing video cameras or panic buttons
        + providing seating for the minor’s parent or legal guardian in close proximity  
          other remedies as appropriate
   7. **Laboratories**  
      No minor shall be present in a laboratory during any activity with the potential for exposure to hazardous materials. Children under the age of 13 are permitted in University research laboratories only as participants (subjects of study) in an approved research study; children under the age of 13 are not permitted in University research laboratories for any other reason, due to the risk presented to a child’s developing immune/neurological systems and a child’s general inability to recognize hazards.Youth between the ages of 13 and 17 may enter laboratories as part of officially sanctioned, educational programs approved in writing in advance by the Unit Head responsible for oversight of the laboratory and when under the direct supervision of a University employee who is trained and knowledgeable of the area’s hazards. They may participate in and perform routine education-related duties and may handle lower risk chemicals and biological materials in limited circumstances, with proper safety equipment as necessary, at the discretion of the principal investigator. Minors may not directly handle radioactive materials, materials at biosafety level 2 or higher (including rDNA, human blood, tissues or cell cultures, or pathogens) or research animals.Prior to allowing minor visitors to tour or observe in a lab, the supervising employee must conduct a basic safety orientation with participants, including both general safety information and any hazards particular to the lab in question.  
      Before a minor may participate in educational activities in a research laboratory:
      * the minor must be sponsored by a faculty member
      * the minor must complete training with the PI and the PI must document the training
      * the PI must obtain the following signed agreements and maintain them so that they are readily accessible during an emergency: a) Emergency Medical Contact, Health History and Medical Treatment Authorization; b) Parent Acknowledgement of Risk, Release of Liability and Consent to Photograph/Record Form; c) permission to participate in research activity.
