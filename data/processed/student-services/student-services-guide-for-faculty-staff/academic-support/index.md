Center for Academic Success & Tutoring (CAST) offers learning support programs to assure high quality services to Montclair State University students. The quality learning is centered on the student as an individual. Therefore, CAST continues to construct a body of work focused on the academic needs of a rapidly growing student population.

The Center for Academic Success and Tutoring, certified by The College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA) and the National Tutoring Association (NTA), provides tutoring, supplemental instruction, and academic development services including coaching and workshops. Further-more, the national and international professional standards set by The CRLA are maintained through the application of innovative learning theories, tutoring practices, and cross-cultural training programs.

CAST is dedicated to providing an environment that promotes learning and professional growth where students and tutors work together in reaching their academic goals. The individual and group tutoring sessions are offered in most academic areas by master and peer tutors who have excelled in their particular subject areas and have been recommended by faculty. All tutors receive training on effective study strategies and tutoring techniques, and are evaluated on their skills to demonstrate a continual learning mindset.

The Center for Academic Success & Tutoring (CAST) offers [Academic Development](https://www.montclair.edu/policies/all-policies/academic-retention-standards/), [Tutoring Services](https://www.montclair.edu/center-for-academic-success-and-tutoring/tutorial-services/), [Supplemental Instruction](https://www.montclair.edu/center-for-academic-success-and-tutoring/) and learning support to Montclair students in collaboration with academic and administrative departments. Students are encouraged to take advantage of CAST tutoring which fosters active learning, reasoning, and critical thinking. Additionally, the tutors working at CAST are well trained in applying learning strategies and tutoring techniques to help students become more confident and competent learners while facing academic challenges head-on and mastering course content.

The Center advertises the tutoring schedule at the beginning of the semester and we encourage students to [sign up](https://montclair.campus.eab.com/) for a tutoring account to take advantage of the ability to schedule in person and on-line tutoring appointments in our various tutoring locations.

Advising

Academic advising is a developmental process in which students and academic advisors engage that focuses on helping students achieve their academic, personal and career goals.

Disability Resource Center

* **Location:** Cole Hall, Room 331
* **Telephone:** 973-655-5431
* [Disability Resource Center Website](http://www.montclair.edu/disability-resource-center/)

The Mission of the Disability Resource Center (DRC) is to unite the Montclair State University community in an effort to provide students with disabilities the excellence and equity in education to which they are legally entitled. Support from faculty is integral to the achievement of this mission. It is the hope of the DRC that sharing this information will promote collaboration between the DRC and faculty as well as provide you with some strategies, to see that all students are encouraged to meet their full potential.

Although it may seem simpler to just accommodate students directly without the involvement of the DRC, that approach can be risky. The DRC has the expertise to ascertain whether the request is appropriate and reasonable. If you provide an  accommodation without proper documentation, other students can challenge this treatment as preferential. Also, by providing an unsubstantiated accommodation, a pattern is set under which a student can claim to be “considered as having a disability” under the law. Therefore when students approach faculty about disability issues, it is strongly recommend that they are referred to the DRC.

Section 504 and the ADA are very specific regarding confidentiality issues. Students voluntarily affiliate themselves with DRC, and the responsibility to protect their confidentiality is taken seriously.

**How can the Disability Resource Center help you as a faculty member?**

Although it may seem contradictory to some that the DRC’s goal is to team with the faculty to accommodate the student; that is our true mission. The center advocates for students, but is also available to consult with and assist faculty in meeting the University’s legal responsibilities to students with disabilities.

The law permits dissemination of disability-related information on a “need to know” basis only. Therefore when faculty is alerted, the center is permitted to disclose only the existence, not the nature, of a disability and what accommodations are necessary to equalize access to learning for that student. Asking intrusive questions of the student or discussing the student’s disability with  
others, no matter how well-intentioned, is a violation of federal law.

Education Opportunity Fund Program

* **Location:** Cole Hall, Room 301
* **Telephone:** 973-655-4385
* [Education Opportunity Fund Website](https://www.montclair.edu/educational-opportunity-fund/)

Montclair State University’s Educational Opportunity Fund Program (EOF) provides access for motivated state residents from  
underrepresented populations/areas that meet the income criteria and exhibit the potential for high achievement. The Educational Opportunity Fund Program provides quality academic support, leadership development, financial literacy, career enrichment, intentional counseling/advisement, and need based financial assistance to maximize the intellectual and social growth of all participants. The EOF community fully engages scholars in curricular and co-curricular experiences ultimately  
producing active alumni dedicated to lifelong learning and global citizenship.

**How can the Educational Opportunity Fund Program help you as a faculty member?**

EOF Students are assigned EOF Professional Counselors who can be used as a resource for a student’s academic development  
(tutoring, writing workshops, etc.). Progress reports are sent to faculty members for EOF students and other select special admit populations to ensure students maximize the use of their academic resources.

Experience Montclair

Experience Montclair (EM) is a University-wide initiative designed to provide activities, events and workshops to help students stimulate intellectual curiosity and career readiness through academic and co-curricular programming. This initiative promotes active student engagement starting in the very first semester. As students begin their transition to college life they will be presented with opportunities to explore areas of personal and professional interest in order to gain necessary skills for future employment and/or graduate study. By employing a competency-based approach, student engagement can be translated into competencies to make sense for students, administrators, family members and potential employers.
