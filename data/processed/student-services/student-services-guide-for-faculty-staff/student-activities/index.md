Montclair State University sponsors 18 varsity athletic teams, eight for men and ten for women, comprised of approximately 550 student athletes. Sport offerings include baseball and softball, men’s and women’s basketball, field hockey, football, men’s and women’s lacrosse, men’s and women’s soccer, men’s and women’s swimming and diving, men’s and women’s indoor and outdoor  
track and field, women’s cross country and women’s volleyball. Montclair State competes in Division III of the NCAA, and as such, student athletes do not receive scholarships or financial aid based on athletic ability. The University’s primary conference affiliation is the New Jersey Athletic Conference, and students also compete in the Metropolitan Conference for Swimming and Diving. Montclair State hosts on average, 150 home regular athletic contests each academic year.

The staff of the Montclair State Intercollegiate Athletic Department has a strong commitment to the academic success of all our student athletes. Montclair State University students have very demanding schedules and the department’s goal is to ensure that they can balance the demands of practice, competition and travel alongside the demands of college course work. The staff of the Academic Center for Excellence coordinate study halls, workshops, advisement, and recommend schedules for students that don’t conflict with the requirements for participation in their particular sport. Students are asked to work with faculty members to arrange for reasonable accommodation when scheduling conflicts arise. Professors should always feel free to contact Academic Services for Athletes for confirmation of schedule changes or inquiries about a student athlete at 973-655-5125.

**How can the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics help you as a  faculty and staff member?**

Faculty are encouraged to get involved in the Faculty Hawks program, which is a campus wide initiative to bring student athletes and faculty together. If you are interested in joining the group, please contact the department at 973-655-5234. On-campus games and contests are great places to get together with other staff members, students and family members. All home events are free to faculty and staff, and offer an enjoyable outlet on weekday afternoons, evenings, and weekends. Up to date schedules can be found on the Athletic Department website. If a department would like to have a reception or get together at any athletic contests, the Athletic Department would be happy to assist you in coordinating an event.
