## A Message from the Vice President

Dear Members of the Montclair State Community,

The division of Student Development and Campus Life supports the academic and personal growth and development for the students of Montclair State University. With a focus on access, support services, holistic wellness, safety and inclusion, we are responsible for fostering an environment for student success outside the classroom and helping our students feel a true sense of belonging while at Montclair State.

Students may come to you or you may notice a student in need of assistance. Please know our team is ready to support you and the students you work with at any time. Together, we can provide an environment that supports the highest levels of success, compassion and belonging for all of our students. This guide has been developed to provide an overview of all we have to offer you and our students.

All of us in SDCL want to thank you in advance for taking the time to review this website. Please do not hesitate to contact me, our Dean of Studentâ€™s Office or anyone on our SDCL team if you have any questions regarding the students you work with. Together we can create a living and learning environment for our students that fosters student success, engagement and belonging at every level.

With warmest regards,

Dawn Meza Soufleris, Ph.D.  
Vice President for Student Development and Campus Life
