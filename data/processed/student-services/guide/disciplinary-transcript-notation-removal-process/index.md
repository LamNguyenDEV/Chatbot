After all the term(s) of the suspension have been fulfilled, a student may request that the Disciplinary Suspension notation be removed from the studentâ€™s official transcript.

**Prior to Doing So, the Student Must Have:**

1. Re-enrolled at the University upon the completion of their suspension;

2. Provide information on how the student has grown from the incident and document their activities since returning to the University.
3. Request will be submitted in a Microsoft Word document and will be no more than three pages.

Upon receipt and initial review, the Office of Student Conduct will forward the request to the Vice President of Student Development and Campus Life.

Upon receipt of the request, the Vice President of Student Development and Campus Life will confer with the Dean of Students or designee to review the request and consider approval or denial.

**Factors to Be Considered In Review of Such Requests Will Include:**

5. The information provided by the student in the request.

The decision to remove the notation shall rest in the discretion and judgment of the Vice President of Student Development and Campus Life or designee. The Office of Student Conduct will notify the student of the decision. All reviews are final and not subject to challenge.
