# Team Rocky

In 2015 a group of undergraduate and graduate students was formed called Team Rocky. These student leaders encourage others to get involved and stay connected to campus and always show their Red Hawk Pride.

## Rocky Represents All Red Hawks

Team Rocky members dedicate themselves to be an ambassador to Montclair State University, are knowledgeable about our campus, willing to develop their leadership and communication skills and constantly commit their time volunteering for this team. All Team Rocky Members are considered student leaders of Montclair State University and will be held at a higher standard. The following expectations must be followed:

* Keep a cumulative GPA of 2.75 or higher.
* Stay in good standing with the University.
* Complete a series of requirements each semester.
* Keep Rocky’s identity a secret.

## Want to Join Team Rocky?

Openings depend on how many students graduate each year. Some years we may have 10 open spots and others maybe only one or two. Do you think you have what it takes? **Check out [Rocky’s Engage page](https://montclair.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/rocky-the-red-hawk) to see if applications are open!**
