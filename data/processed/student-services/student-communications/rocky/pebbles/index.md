## About Pebbles

Pebbles is a mini labradoodle born on November 1, 2022, and she joined our Montclair family on February 17, 2023. Don’t let her size fool you… this small pup has a big presence and an even bigger heart! She lives on campus with her mom, Thea Dyer, Assistant Director for Residence Life and has quickly become a familiar face (and furry friend) to students, staff,and families. From Welcome Week to finals season, Pebbles is always ready to brighten your day.

## Why a Pupscot?

Everyone needs a pal…even Rocky. But Pebbles is more than just a sidekick, she’s part of a broader mission to support student well-being and belonging. Students often say they miss their pets back home and seeing Pebbles brings a much-needed dose of comfort, fun and emotional support to campus. While therapy dogs visit once or twice a semester, Pebbles is here year-round to offer tail wags, cuddles and community connection.
