# Student Communications & Red Hawk Life

Student Communications and Red Hawk Life, housed within the [Division of Student Development and Campus Life](https://www.montclair.edu/student-development-campus-life/), is the centralized department for communicating with **current students** and their **families**. We craft clear, timely and authentic messaging that bridges communication gaps, fosters engagement and promotes belonging across the Montclair and Bloomfield campuses. Our mascot programs further this mission by inspiring campus pride and carrying forward the spirit and tradition of Montclair State University by hosting annual programs open to all.

## What We Do

* **Email to Students:** We send key deadlines, emergency alerts, registration information and payment reminders through [msuadmin@montclair.edu](mailto:msuadmin@montclair.edu). We also publish **Red Hawk News**, a weekly newsletter featuring events, deadlines, career opportunities and student resources. Targeted messages are available for groups like residents, commuters and class years.
* **Social Media:** We run a variety of social media pages, some of which are managed by our students! Follow [Red Hawk Life](https://linktr.ee/redhawklife) for campus news, reminders, student profiles and to view our popular trivia series “Prize Ride.” [Hawk Squad](https://linktr.ee/hawksquadmontclair?fbclid=PAAaZwJJ04XSNF6vZgFiPcVduQ2PHMAaPOGoso2FHwl5MHzfsn-HV-SAKGv08_aem_ATmScXFF-gUUTzfKqs4SCAemZQ-WXVaCbDbhgaqBn7kn9Hl6B8UnAzuaigZHPh-zd8Q) is another great account which features events, clubs and organizations to help keep students in the loop and involved!
* **Emergency Alerts:** [**Rave Mobile Safety**](https://www.montclair.edu/university-police/emergency/rave-mobile-safety/), in collaboration with [University Police](https://www.montclair.edu/university-police/) and [University Communications and Marketing](https://www.montclair.edu/university-communications/), sends urgent messages to our campus community in the event of emergencies, threats, weather-related closures and other critical incidents.
* **NEST Portal:** [NEST](https://nest.montclair.edu/) provides student campus announcements, account information, class schedules and financial aid updates.
* **Digital Screens:** Digital monitors across campus display reminders, event promotions and emergency alerts.
* **Graphic Design:** We create branded materials for [Student Development and Campus Life](https://www.montclair.edu/student-development-campus-life/) campus events and initiatives, ensuring consistent and professional design with Red Hawk Pride.
* **Spirit and Traditions:** Our mascots include [**Rocky the Red Hawk**](https://www.montclair.edu/student-services/student-communications/rocky/), his sister **Roxy**, their friend **Deacon the Bloomfield Bear** and [**Pebbles**](https://www.montclair.edu/student-services/student-communications/rocky/pebbles/), our therapy “pupscot.” They build campus spirit and engage with students at events throughout the year.
* **Family Communication:** We believe parents are our partners, so we make it a point to keep them involved through our parent portal, [CampusESP](https://www.montclair.edu/parents-family/) where they can receive newsletters, sign up for webinars and get insider information on events such as Homecoming and Family Weekend!
