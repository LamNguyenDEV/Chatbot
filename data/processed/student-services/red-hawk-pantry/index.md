# Red Hawk Pantry

To combat the reality and struggle of food insecurity for our community, Student Development and Campus Life (SDCL) established the Red Hawk Pantry. On April 18, 2016, the on-campus food pantry opened for the first time and continues to serve the needs of our campus community. To assess these needs, a survey was sent out before the opening of the pantry. Of the nearly 200 replies, 10% expressed food insecurity daily, while 15% expressed a need on a weekly basis and 12% on a monthly basis.

In July 2016, the University launched a fundraising campaign to help sustain the pantry and allow it to become self-sustaining and continue to serve the needs of our campus community. Gifts to the campaign help the Red Hawk Pantry offer more hours, stock more supplies and expand its services to our campus community.

**The Red Hawk Pantry is open to all Montclair State University community members: students, faculty and staff.**
