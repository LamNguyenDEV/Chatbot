# Get Help

## First Steps

**Are you in danger?** If yes, contact University police at **973-655-5222** on-campus or **911** off-campus.

### Do You Need Medical Attention?

You can receive medical attention at any medical facility, and the [**Student Health Center**](https://www.montclair.edu/student-health-center/) has trained staff to work with survivors of sexual assault.

If you choose, you can request a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) to perform a confidential forensic examination for evidence collection, receive access to medical care for the prevention of infections and pregnancy, evaluation and treatment of possible injuries. Completing a medical exam does not require you to file a police report or report to the institution.

If possible, avoid washing or changing clothes until after a medical exam. Evidence of sexual assault can deteriorate quickly, so seek medical attention as soon as possible, ideally within 120 hours (5 days). Even if you have washed, some evidence may still be collected. Bring clothes worn during the assault in a clean paper bag or wrapped in a sheet. Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE) are trained to collect forensic evidence, check for injuries, and prevent infections. You may also receive care beyond 120 hours, even if you donâ€™t pursue evidence collection.
