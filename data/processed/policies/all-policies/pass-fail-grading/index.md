# Pass/Fail Grading – Undergraduate Students

## About This Policy

*This policy is for undergraduate students.*

**Purpose:** A primary aim of the Pass/Fail policy is to stoke intellectual curiosity in students. This policy encourages students to enroll in courses to follow interests or try new challenges without worrying about an impact on their grade point average.

**Eligible Courses:** Free electives, courses meeting General Education 2002 requirements, and courses meeting SEEDS General Education, Explorations Student Learning Outcomes.

**Ineligible Courses:** Any course meeting major, minor, collateral, and teacher certiﬁcation, or SEEDS courses that are required for the major are ineligible for Pass/Fail grading. SEEDS courses that meet any Foundations Student Learning Outcome are also ineligible.  Additionally, no courses required for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program are eligible for Pass/Fail grading. Grades of P do not satisfy prerequisite requirements when a minimum letter grade (for example C- or higher) is required to advance to the next course. Some exceptions may apply from the spring 2020 semester, due to the policy modified during the COVID-19 health emergency.

**Grading:** Students will receive either a grade of “P” (pass) or “F” (fail) for coursework completed under the option. A grade of “P” has no impact on the student’s overall grade point average. A grade of “F” will have the same effect on the grade point average as a traditional failure. Please note that a “P” grade may not be accepted for transfer at other institutions, or may impact the success of graduate school or professional school applications in the future.

**Credit and Term Limits:** Students may take up to 12 semester hours total as pass/fail.

**Deadlines:** Students must elect the Pass/Fail option each semester by the Last Day to Withdraw for the term in which the course is being taken (the specific date for each term will be posted on the University’s Important Dates webpage). Students may not elect the Pass/Fail option retroactively. Once the election of Pass/Fail has been made, the student may no longer choose to receive a letter grade other than P/F for the course.  Advisor approval is required to confirm the student will meet the residency requirement, and so the student understands any impacts on possible majors or post-secondary degree programs.
