## Federal Perkins Loan

Federal Perkins Loan (FPLN) is a loan awarded by Montclair State University to students with exceptional need. Perkins Loans carry a fixed interest rate of 5% for the duration of the ten-year repayment period. Award amounts vary depending on financial need and level of available funds. Students must file a *Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)*as part of the application process for a Perkins Loan and demonstrate high financial need.

If you have been awarded a Federal Perkins Loan, you would have signed and returned the Master Promissory Note to the Office of Student Financial Aid – College Hall, Room 208 completed the Entrance Counseling and signed the Federal Perkins Loan Disclosure Statement.

### Requirements needed for the Federal Perkins Loan Program are as follows:

* Enrollment in an eligible school at least half-time in a degree program
* U.S. citizens, Permanent Residents, or eligible non-citizen status
* Satisfactory academic progress ( You must have a passing Grade to keep your Loan)
* No unresolved defaults or overpayments owed on Title IV education loans and grants
* Satisfaction of all Selective Service requirements

### Repayment of a Federal Perkins Loan:

Repayment of a Federal Perkins Loan begins (9) nine months after a student graduates, leaves school, or drops below half-time status.

* This nine-month period is known as the grace period.
* At the end of the grace period, a borrower must begin repayment and is allowed up to 10 years to repay the Federal Perkins Loan in full.
* The monthly repayment amount is based on the size of the borrower’s debt and the length of the repayment period.

If you cannot make payments on your loan after the nine-month grace period, you may be able to postpone repayment by pursuing deferment or forbearance. Under certain circumstances, a borrower can receive a deferment or forbearance on the Federal Perkins Loan. The loan can also qualify for cancellation under certain unusual conditions. For more information, contact Norma Kuruc at 973-655-4132 or Lynn Wells at 973-655-7593.

### Perkins Loan in Default

“Default” in the Federal Perkins Loan Program is defined as “the failure of a student / borrower to make an installment payment when due or to comply with other terms of the promissory note or written repayment agreement. A loan made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program is in default on the first day after a payment is past due.

If an account is in a delinquent or defaulted status, a financial hold is placed on the account. Any request for transcripts, re-admission, diplomas and/or certifications are denied until the delinquency or default has been satisfied.

Prior to a Perkins’s Loan being placed in a Collection Agency, the U.S. Department of Education sends a DRAP letter to the student/ borrower in order to get the student/ borrower back into a repayment schedule. Once the loan account is placed in collection or legal action is pursued by the collection agency, the student / borrower will be liable for all collection and/or attorney’s fees (20% to 40% of the amount placed in collection).
