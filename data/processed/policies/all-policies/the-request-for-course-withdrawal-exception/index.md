:   [Dean of Students](https://www.montclair.edu/policies/responsible-office/dean-of-students/)

---

**Eligibility:**

* This option is available only under extreme life circumstances that prevent a student from successfully completing the semester beyond the last day to withdraw on their own. Such circumstances may include: death of a parent or spouse; incapacitating accident; extended hospitalization; other severe conditions that prevent class attendance and necessitate withdrawal from the entire semester

**Ineligible Reasons:**

* **Requests based on reasons such as failure to attend class, failing work, lack of attendance, dislike of the instructor, wrong course choice, lack of interest, or conflict in teaching style are not considered valid.**

**Process:**

* Requests must be made within the academic year and are not considered retroactively.
* Withdrawals must be for all classes, not individual courses.
* Only courses with an earned grade of D- or F are eligible for withdrawal consideration.

#### **Steps to Request Withdrawal**

1. **Submission:**
   * The student submits a Request for Course Withdrawal Exception form, available online on the Dean of Student webpage.
   * Supporting documentation substantiating the extreme life circumstance is required.
2. **Meeting:**
   * After submitting the request and documentation, the student may be required to meet with a member of the Dean of Students staff.
3. **Final Determination:**
   * The Dean of Students Office will inform the student of the final decision via email.
4. **Requests:**
   * Approved withdrawals can take up to 6 weeks to process. All requests must be reviewed by Student Accounts and Financial Aid for financial implications.
   * If the withdrawal request is not approved, the Dean of Students will recommend the student consult their advisor for guidance on academic standing, future course selection, and other academic assistance.
