# Withdrawal or Leave of Absence from the University – Undergraduate

## About This Policy

Responsible Office
:   [Academic Affairs](https://www.montclair.edu/policies/responsible-office/academic-affairs/)

## Definitions

Leave of Absence
:   A formal pause in enrollment where a student plans on taking no more than a one semester break in enrollment (fall or spring).

Withdrawal
:   A formal end to enrollment where a student has no intention of re-enrolling, or intends to re-enroll after a two-or-more consecutive semester break in enrollment.

## Policy

The following policy applies to Undergraduate students only. Graduate students requesting a leave of absence or withdrawal from the University must contact The Graduate School.

Undergraduate Students wishing to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the University must complete an official request. Each student request must be reviewed and certified by the students’ College/School designee before being made official.

It is the student’s responsibility to drop, or withdraw from, their classes for the effective term in which the leave of absence or withdrawal is requested; courses will be withdrawn administratively if a student fails to do so on their own. Students must adhere to the deadlines and refund policies for the current semester.

Notification to a faculty member, course instructor, academic advisor, or other University staff member does not constitute a drop or withdrawal from a course, or the University.

Students who are not enrolled for two consecutive semesters (fall or spring) must apply for re-admission to Montclair State University. Re-admission to the University, or a prior major, is not automatic.

Students facing disciplinary action, who seek to withdraw from the University, should refer to the Student Code of Conduct and/or contact the Dean of Students.
