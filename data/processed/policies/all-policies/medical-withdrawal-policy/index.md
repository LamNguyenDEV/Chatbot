# Medical Withdrawal Policy

## About This Policy

Responsible Office
:   [Student Development Campus Life](https://www.montclair.edu/policies/responsible-office/student-development-campus-life/)

Montclair State University students who experience physical, psychological and/or other extenuating circumstances that substantially impair their ability to function successfully or safely as a student may be eligible for a Medical Withdrawal.

Dropping all classes for the semester does not constitute a Medical Withdrawal. A Medical Withdrawal determination will be based on an evaluation by a Montclair State University clinician or in consultation with an off-campus treatment provider regarding the severity and onset of the mental or physical condition. This condition’s impact on the student’s ability to attend classes and perform academically, or after requested reasonable accommodations have been provided by the University, will also serve as a basis for determination of withdrawal. It is expected that time away from the University will be used for treatment and recovery.

### Please Note

* A medical withdrawal does not automatically result in a tuition refund or adjustment.
* There may be significant financial implications, including a possible reduction or loss of financial aid.
* Students are strongly encouraged to consult with the following offices before initiating medical withdrawal paperwork:
  + [Office of the Dean of Students](https://www.montclair.edu/dean-of-students/)
  + [Red Hawk Central](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/)
* Veteran and Military Affiliated Students are highly encouraged to communicate with the Office of Veteran and Military Services prior to submitting a Medical Withdrawal. Medical Withdrawals can impact a student’s VA benefits.

## Steps for Requesting a Medical Withdrawal

Step 1

Complete the Medical Withdrawal Interest and Acknowledgement Form

All students interested in a Medical Withdrawal must fill out this [Interest and Acknowledgement Form](https://montclair.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bPiXlvomVfE3iHc). The form confirms the student’s understanding of:

* The Medical Withdrawal process
* Potential financial consequences
* The impact on financial aid eligibility

Step 2

Schedule a Medical Evaluation

Once the Medical Withdrawal Interest and Acknowledgement Form is submitted, a member of the appropriate department will contact the student to schedule an appointment.

The departments that can submit a Medical Withdrawal recommendation are as follows:

* **Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)** handles withdrawal requests due to mental health conditions.
  + Students must submit relevant medical documentation **before** their CAPS evaluation.
* **The Student Health Center (SHC)** handles withdrawal requests due to physical health conditions.
  + Students requesting medical withdrawals processed through the Student Health Center will receive a packet with instructions for obtaining documentation at their intake appointment.
* **The Disability Resource Center (DRC)** handles the withdrawal requests for students who are already registered with the office.
  + Students will meet with a qualified CAPS or SHC clinician. CAPS or SHC will coordinate with DRC as needed, upon the student’s request.

Step 3

Provide Medical Documentation

If the student has been treated by an **off-campus provider**, they must:

1. Sign a consent form allowing CAPS, SHC, or DRC to communicate with the provider.
2. Submit comprehensive documentation from the provider that includes:
   * Diagnosis
   * Date of onset
   * Impact on academic performance
   * Prognosis
   * Treatment plan
   * Estimated timeline for treatment and recovery

**Note:** While medical withdrawals are assessed on a case-by-case basis, it will be more difficult to consider your request without the necessary medical documentation.

Step 4

Review and Recommendation

Once all documentation has been reviewed, CAPS, the SHC or the DRC will make a recommendation to the Office of the Dean of Students for a **full or partial** Medical Withdrawal.

## Important Points

* Medical Withdrawals will only be granted in the **current semester**. Retroactive requests will not be considered.
* A **full** Medical Withdrawal will require that all courses from that semester are withdrawn or dropped. A **partial** Medical Withdrawal will require that only some courses from that semester are withdrawn or dropped. **Partial medical withdrawals will only be approved in very limited circumstances.**
* Withdrawal processing is based on the **last date of attendance or participation in an academically related activity** as reported by the student. Please see the chart below for more information on what counts as academically related activity. The University reserves the right to verify this information with the faculty. **Providing false information may result in denial of the request and/or referral to the Office of Student Conduct.**

## What Counts as an Academically Related Activity?

Examples of Academic-Related Activity&sol; Academic Engagement

* Attending a live (in-person or online) class, lab, or lecture with instructor-student interaction.
* Submitting academic assignments.
* Taking exams or assessments.
* Participating in interactive tutorials, webinars, or group work assigned by the school.
* Participating in an online discussion about academic matters.
* Communicating with an instructor about academic topics studied in the course.

NOT considered Academic-Related Activity&sol; Academic Engagement

* Withdrawing from some, not all, courses.
* Living in campus housing.
* Using a meal plan.
* Logging into a class without participating.
* Attending academic advising (This is a support service and is not direct coursework.)

## Partial Medical Withdrawals

Partial medical withdrawals will only be approved in very limited circumstances.

Partial medical withdrawals **WILL NOT** be considered after the University’s “Last day to withdraw” from classes, except in extreme cases, such as hospitalization during that time.

The last date to withdraw may be found on the [Important Dates](https://www.montclair.edu/student-services/important-dates/) webpage.

## Academic Records and Transcript Notations

Withdrawn courses will be recorded as “WD” on the student’s transcript.

Dropped courses will not appear on the transcript.

## Deadlines and Housing Information

The **deadline to submit a Medical Withdrawal request** is six (6) business days before the end of the semester. For details, see the [Important Dates](https://www.montclair.edu/student-services/important-dates/) webpage.

**On-campus residents** approved for a **full** Medical Withdrawal must vacate University housing and return their keys to Residence Life **within 24 hours of notification**.

## Understanding the Financial Implications of Full Medical Withdrawals for Fall 2025

You can find the dates for other scenarios on the [Add/Drop and Withdrawal](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/registrar/add-drop/) webpage and more information on the [What Happens When I Withdraw from Class?](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/registrar/add-drop/what-happens-when-i-withdraw-from-class/) page.

**If you withdraw between 8/29 and 9/8 (Add/Drop Period):**

* **Tuition and Fees:** 100% of your tuition and fees will be canceled.
* **Financial Aid:** The Federal Calculation formula is required based on the official withdrawal date. NJ State aid not applied to billed charges must be canceled. In many cases, the student will owe money to the University.
* **Refund Payment:** If the student previously received a refund, they are responsible for repaying those funds back to the University.
* **On-Campus Housing and Meals:** Housing charges may be prorated based on the student’s last recorded use of their ID card in the residence halls. Any housing or meal adjustment is at the full discretion of Residence Life and/or Dining Services. Students must appeal directly to Residence Life and/or Dining Services for adjustment requests to housing or meal plan charges.

**If you withdraw between 9/9 and 9/25:**

* **Tuition and Fees:** Tuition and fees will be reduced by 50%.
* **Financial Aid:** The Federal Calculation formula is required based on the official withdrawal date. If state grants were credited to the bill, they must be adjusted/canceled based on NJHESAA policy. In many cases, the student will owe money to the University.
* **On-Campus Housing and Meals:** Housing charges may be prorated based on the student’s last recorded use of their ID card in the residence halls. Any housing or meal adjustment is at the full discretion of Residence Life and/or Dining Services. Students must appeal directly to Residence Life and/or Dining Services for adjustment requests to housing or meal plan charges.

**If you withdraw between 9/26 and 11/3:**

* **Tuition and Fees:** There is no tuition and fee adjustment. Students are responsible for the full amount for tuition and fees.
* **Financial Aid:** The Federal Calculation formula is required based on the official withdrawal date. Disbursed State grants are not changed. In many cases, the student will owe money to the University.
* **On-Campus Housing and Meals:** Housing charges may be prorated based on the student’s last recorded use of their ID card in the residence halls. Any housing or meal adjustment is at the full discretion of Residence Life and/or Dining Services. Students must appeal directly to Residence Life and/or Dining Services for adjustment requests to housing or meal plan charges.

**If you withdraw on or after 11/4:**

* **Tuition and Fees:** There is no tuition and fee adjustment. Students are responsible for the full amount for tuition and fees.
* **Financial Aid:** All of your financial aid is retained; none is canceled.
* **On-Campus Housing and Meals:** Students are responsible for any remaining charges. Charges as it relates to a student’s meal plan are non-refundable and not prorated.

## Other Implications

Both full and partial Medical Withdrawals may have significant consequences such as loss of financial aid and future disbursements, loss of housing, and negative effects on [satisfactory academic progress (SAP)](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/financial-aid/sap-regulations/) and loan repayment timelines. It is essential that you understand these implications before proceeding.

## International Students

Students in F-1 or J-1 Visa status should consult the Office of Global Engagement prior to requesting a medical withdrawal to determine the effect on their legal immigration status. The office is located in Cole Hall, Suite 148.
