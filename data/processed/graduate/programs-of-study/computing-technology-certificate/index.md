## Computing Technology (Certificate) Online

The Online Graduate Certificate in Computing Technology provides basic foundational knowledge in the field of computer science and information technology. The certificate provides a standalone credential for career-building and advancement opportunities.

Students will learn the fundamentals of computer software programming and computer hardware, as well as, discrete mathematics and data structures and algorithms. Additionally, in support of the Department of Computer Science’s four graduate programs (MS in Computer Science, MS in Information Technology, MS in Information Technology, Applied Information Technology/PSM, MS in Cybersecurity), this certificate can be used as a bridge program to transition students from unrelated fields who may not have the requisite knowledge in computer science.
