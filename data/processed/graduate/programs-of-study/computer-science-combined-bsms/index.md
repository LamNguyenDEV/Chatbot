## Computer Science (Combined BS/MS)

The Computer Science combined BS/MS is an accelerated (five year) program which allows students to obtain both a master’s and a bachelor’s degree simultaneously. The computer science curriculum prepares students to design and implement software, to consider new ways to use computers, to assist in improving solutions to computer problems, and generally helps students to adapt to new ideas. Students should have taken all required computer science courses up through CMPT 371 at Montclair State University.

Along with the Computer Science (Combined BS/MS) degree, the Computer Science department also offers a [Computer Science (MS)](http://www.montclair.edu/graduate/computer-science-ms/) degree. Please refer to our [programs of study](http://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/) page for a comprehensive list of all of the graduate programs offered within the university.

Admission Requirements

Undergraduate computer science majors with a minimum GPA of 3.0 in computer science at the end of the first semester of their junior year are eligible to apply for the combined BS/MS program. They will be admitted beginning in the first semester of the following academic year. Students who have completed the BS in Computer Science are not eligible for this program.
