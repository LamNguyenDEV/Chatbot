# Computer Science (MS)

[Apply Now](/graduate/how-to-apply/)[Frequently Asked Questions](/graduate/how-to-apply/frequently-asked-questions/)[Request Information](https://graduate.montclair.edu/register/grad-inquiry)[Upcoming Events](https://graduate.montclair.edu/portal/graduate-events)

## Computer Science (MS) – STEM Designated Degree Program

The graduate program in computer science is designed for students interested in pursuing computer science theoretically as well as practically at an advanced level. While introducing students to newly developing areas of computer science, this program emphasizes the foundations and concepts of the field. Concepts are developed rather than routine programming skills. Students are prepared for professional work in the design and implementation of software systems, database systems, operating systems, artificial intelligence, expert systems, graphics, simulation and algorithms for discrete and continuous structures that will aid in the solution of problems encountered in the scientific and business sector. The curriculum is designed to allow students to develop skills needed to achieve leadership positions in business, industry and government in computer science or in related fields that are computer science intensive. The program also prepares teachers of computer science at the two year college, high school and middle school levels.

Along with the Computer Science (MS) degree, the Computer Science department also offers a [Computer Science (Combined BS/MS)](http://www.montclair.edu/graduate/computer-science-combined-bsms/) degree.

Please refer to our [programs of study](http://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/) page for a comprehensive list of all of the graduate programs offered within the university.

Admission Requirements

* Applicants must possess a bachelor’s degree from an accredited institution with either:
  + A major in computer science or mathematics.
  + A major in science or engineering.
  + Another major with an overall cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 (B) or other indications of the ability to complete the program.
* Students desiring to enter the MS in Computer Science without an appropriate background in computer science can obtain the necessary foundation in computer science and mathematics by taking courses in our prerequisite program.  Upon satisfactory completion of part or all of the program, students are admitted to the Master of Science program.

The Office of Graduate Admissions requires the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor’s degree in order to be eligible to apply for a graduate program. Applicants with non-U.S. degrees, please visit the [International Applicants](/graduate/how-to-apply/international-applicants/) page to review the U.S. degree equivalency information.
