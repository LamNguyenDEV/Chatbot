[Apply Now](/graduate/how-to-apply/)[Frequently Asked Questions](/graduate/how-to-apply/frequently-asked-questions/)[Request Information](https://graduate.montclair.edu/register/grad-inquiry)[Upcoming Events](https://graduate.montclair.edu/portal/graduate-events)

## Cybersecurity (MS) – STEM Designated Degree Program

The primary objective of the MS degree in Cybersecurity is to train students on a broad range of security related topics with hands-on experience and preparing them to be part of next generation Cybersecurity workforce to meet the growing demand for Cybersecurity professionals in industry, academia and government agencies. In addition, students will have a unique opportunity of doing research on related security projects.

A total of 30 credits are required for the MS in Cybersecurity degree completion. Students who have limited or no background in Computer Science and/or Information Technology may be accepted under the condition of bridging the gap through completion of one to four additional courses in Computer Science Fundamentals. The program will combine the fundamentals of Cybersecurity (covered in the core courses), with the freedom to choose the areas of Cybersecurity they will study deeper (electives from Cybersecurity courses). Graduates will be prepared to either join the work force or further pursue academic advancement.

Our program is uniquely positioned to: (1) accommodate professionals from diverse academic backgrounds and (2) provide a broader coverage of Cybersecurity topics with computational as well as legal and ethical training.  This approach will address demands in both technical and managerial fields of Cybersecurity.

Additional benefits of this program include:

* Comprehensive and affordable
* Students gain state-of-the-art cybersecurity skills to meet the demands of fast-growing industry
* Flexible curriculum taught by Ph.D.-level cybersecurity experts
* Opportunity to work on cutting-edge research projects
* Access to modern infrastructure and computing equipment in the Center for Computing and Information Science

In summary, the Master in Cybersecurity will provide students with a comprehensive and affordable education to meet the growing demand for trained Cybersecurity professionals.  While many other university programs require a substantial technical background and train students for technical positions our program also takes in account other aspects of Cybersecurity such as legal, ethical and policy.
