# International Graduate Applicants

The Office of Global Engagement staff at Montclair State University are available to assist international students through every stage of the journey from new applicant through to graduation.

If you are still completing your last semester of study at a university, or have completed your bachelor’s degree, you may apply for admission as an international graduate student.

**Rolling Admissions Program Deadlines for International Students:**

**If you are *outside* the U.S.:**

* Fall/August semester: June 1
* Spring/January semester: November 1

**If you are *in* the U.S.:**

* Fall/August semester:
  + August 15 (students who are required to submit a credit evaluation\* and do **not** currently have one)
  + September 1 (students who do not require a credential evaluation OR already have a NACES evaluation)
* Spring/January semester:
  + November 15 (students who are required to submit a credit evaluation\* and do **not** currently have one)
  + Early January (students who do not require a credential evaluation OR already have a NACES evaluation)

\*All graduate students are required to submit a transcript evaluation for any courses taken outside of the U.S. See step 3 below.

International students currently in the U.S. may have additional flexibility.

Some programs may be rolling but may offer priority deadlines. Select your major on our [programs of study page](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/) for additional information.

**Non-Rolling Admissions Program Deadlines:**

**All doctoral programs**, as well as select master’s programs (including Athletic Training, Clinical Psychology, Communication Sciences and Disorders, Counseling, Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Psychological Sciences, Public Health, and Social Work) have earlier deadlines. Note that this list is subject to change. Select your major on our [programs of study](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/) page for additional information.

Step 1

Online Application

Submit your application by clicking on the button below:

[Submit the Online Application](https://graduate.montclair.edu/apply/)

Step 2

Application Fee

After you submit the application, you will see instructions for paying the $60 non-refundable application fee on the status page of your application portal.

International students have the option of paying the application fee via wire transfer if unable to pay online or by check/money order. For more information, please contact the Students Accounts office at [studentaccou@montclair.edu](mailto:studentaccou@montclair.edu)

Please note: after your application is submitted and before an admission decision has been rendered, **you may request a one-time change to the academic program** to which you’ve applied. If we’ve already made an admission decision, you’ll need to complete a new application – including another payment of our application fee.

Step 3

Transcripts and Transcript Evaluation

A requirement of your application is to list the name of every institution that you’ve previously attended or are currently attending, regardless of the length of attendance.

If you are an undergraduate student in your last term, you may upload an unofficial copy of your current transcript. Upon acceptance into a graduate program, a final transcript indicating that you have completed your undergraduate studies will be required before the start of classes.

The Office of Graduate Admissions does not evaluate international transcripts. Applicants with a non-U.S. degree must submit an official evaluation of all previous college and university records. You may provide your own or be considered for a free evaluation provided by us to a limited number of qualified students. See the information about transcript evaluations [here](https://www.montclair.edu/global/graduate-transcript-evaluation-options-and-process/).

Step 4

English Language Proficiency Test Scores &lpar;If Required&rpar;

International students, with the exception of those eligible for waivers (noted below), must submit proof of English proficiency. Unofficial score reports are not accepted. **Students must have official scores sent directly from the testing service to Montclair State University**. Students must submit **one** of the following as proof:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Exam** | **Minimum Required Score** | **School Code** |
| [**TOEFL IBT (Test of English as a Foreign Language, Internet Based Test)**](https://www.ets.org/toefl) | 83 | 2520 |
| [**IELTS (International English Language Testing System)**](https://www.ielts.org/en-us) | 6.5 |  |
| [**Duolingo**](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/home) | 105 |  |
| [PTE-A (Pearson Test of English-Academic)](https://www.pearsonpte.com/) | 53 |  |
| [iTEP (International Test of English Proficiency)](https://www.itepexam.com/) | 4.5 |  |

**Exemptions from English Language Proficiency requirement:**

The English Language Proficiency requirement can be waived if you meet one of the criteria listed below:

* Students who are citizens of the United States.
* Students who are citizens of one of the [countries noted here.](https://www.montclair.edu/global/how-to-apply/english-language-proficiency-test-requirement-exemptions)
* Provide a transcript from a regionally accredited university or college located in the United States reflecting a minimum of one academic year (3 quarters or 2 semesters) of full-time enrollment, not including ESL courses
* Provide a transcript from a university or college located in or that follows the curricula of [one of these listed countries](https://www.montclair.edu/global/how-to-apply/english-language-proficiency-test-requirement-exemptions/) (example, American University of Beirut) reflecting a minimum of one academic year (3 quarters or 2 semesters) of full-time enrollment, not including ESL courses.
* **Note: Proof of medium of instruction (MOI) in English is NOT sufficient unless the above criteria are met.**

Step 5

GRE&sol;GMAT Test Scores

The GRE/GMAT is NOT required for many of Montclair State University’s graduate programs. Consult our [programs of study](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/) page to see if the exam is required for your major.

Programs that do ask for submission of a GRE/GMAT exam will often offer waivers for students who meet specific criteria. [Visit the GRE/GMAT exam waiver page](https://gradschool.montclair.edu/gradweb/forms/testwaiverlist.php?test_type=GRE&program=) to view test exemption criteria.

The institutional codes for reporting are as follows:

* GRE: **2520**
* GMAT: full time MBA: **1T2-NK-86**

Step 6

Letters of Recommendation

The majority of graduate programs require two (2) letters of recommendation. Some programs may not require any, and some may require as many as three. As requirements vary by major, please consult our [programs of study](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/) page for information specific to your program.

* During the application process, the online system will give you the option to provide the contact information of your recommenders in the recommendations tab of your application. You will also have the opportunity to add their contact information after you submit in your application portal. They will then receive instructions from Graduate Admissions on how to submit their recommendations electronically.
* Whenever possible, recommendations should be from professors in your undergraduate and graduate field of study who are familiar with your academic work.
* If a significant amount of time has passed since you graduated, recommendation letters can be submitted from employers, supervisors or other professionals who can comment on your background, work experience, and motivation to succeed.
* Friends, family members, or fellow students are not considered appropriate sources for a recommendation letter.

Step 7

Additional Supplemental Application Requirements

Some programs may require submission of additional application items including a resume, a statement of purpose (SOP), an essay, an audition, or a portfolio. As requirements vary by major, please consult our [programs of study](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/) page for information specific to your program.
