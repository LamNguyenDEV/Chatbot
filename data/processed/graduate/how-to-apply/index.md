## Step 1: Choose Your Program of Study

[Begin Your Graduate Application](https://graduate.montclair.edu/apply/)

## Step 3: Submit Your Application and Upload Additional Documents

### Start Your Application

Begin by filling out the [online application form](https://graduate.montclair.edu/apply/).

We recommend setting aside about ten minutes to complete the form in one sitting. For the best experience, we recommend using a desktop device. If you need to return later, you can log back in through the [**application system sign-in page**](https://graduate.montclair.edu/apply/).

After submitting your application, you’ll be able to view the full list of required documents and materials.

### Transcripts

#### All Applicants

You must list *every* college or university you have previously attended, regardless of duration.

If you studied in the U.S., you may upload **unofficial transcripts** through the Applicant Status Portal. Uploading unofficial transcripts is encouraged to prevent processing delays. For more details, see our [FAQ on uploading unofficial transcripts](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/how-to-apply/frequently-asked-questions/).

#### Applicants with Non-U.S. Degrees

In addition to uploading unofficial transcripts, you must submit an official credential evaluation from a NACES-approved organization that includes:

* S. degree equivalency
* Overall GPA

**Course-by-course evaluations** may be required based on your program. Evaluations must come directly from a [**NACES member organization**](https://naces.org/members/). Suggested services include:

* [The Evaluation Company (TEC)](https://evalcompany.com)
* [Educational Perspectives](https://www.edperspective.org)
* [Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE)](https://www.ece.org/ECE/Credential-Evaluations/US-Institutions)
* [International Education Evaluations (IEE)](https://myiee.org/university/montclair-state-university---graduate-school)

**Doctoral applicants** must submit a course-by-course evaluation for all earned degrees.

#### Additional Notes

**Electronic transcripts** (eTranscripts) are accepted and often faster than mailing.

If you’re an undergraduate in your final term:

* You may upload an unofficial transcript.
* A final, official transcript will be required after acceptance and before classes begin.

Regardless of which term you’re starting in, official transcripts from *all* previous institutions must be submitted before classes start.

### Letters of Recommendation

Refer to your [program of study](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/) to determine how many letters are needed.

Recommendations can be managed in two ways:

* Add recommender contact info in the **Recommendations tab** during the application.
* Or, add contacts later in the **Application Status Portal**.

Recommenders will receive instructions to submit their letters electronically.

#### Who Should Submit Letters?

Preferred:
:   Professors familiar with your academic work.

Acceptable:
:   Employers, supervisors or professionals (if you’re returning to school after time away).

Not acceptable:
:   Friends, family members or fellow students.
