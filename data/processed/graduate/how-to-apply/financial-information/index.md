## Financing your Education

Montclair State University prides itself on offering students the opportunity to pursue a world class education with an affordable tuition. In addition, we provide tuition assistance through graduate assistantships, scholarships, and financial aid.

### Red Hawk Central

[Red Hawk Central](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/) is the home of the offices of Students Accounts, Financial Aid, and the Registrar. The goal of Red Hawk Central is to serve as a centralized location for all student services.

* [Office of Student Accounts](http://www.montclair.edu/student-accounts/): The central location for all billing processes related to a student’s educational costs, whether it is payments, credits, refunds or charges related to tuition, fees, room, board, etc.
  + Tuition and Fees: Please review the list of [graduate costs](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/student-accounts/tuition-fees/graduate-costs/) to determine the tuition/fee rates for your intended program.\*Please note that all students who apply to a graduate program will be charged graduate level tuition and fees – regardless of whether or not the courses they enroll in are at the graduate or undergraduate level.

### Assistantship Program

The Graduate School offers a variety of assistantship positions for degree seeking graduate students. Graduate and Teaching Assistantships are available to degree seeking master’s students who are enrolled in their program full-time (six credits or more per semester). Doctoral Fellowship, Doctoral Assistantship, and Doctoral Teaching Assistantship positions are available to degree seeking doctoral students with any enrollment status. The assistantship program is highly competitive and compensation may vary between programs and/or students.
