# Frequently Asked Questions

Admission Review and Application Process FAQs

* **What is the most important part of the application?**  
  Applications and their supplemental items are reviewed holistically. Admission decisions are made based on all the materials submitted, i.e. educational background and grades, work experience (if any), standardized test scores, letters of recommendation and any written statements or essays required for your intended program of study.
* **Who should write my recommendation letters?**Recommendation letters should be written by someone familiar with your previous academic work. Recommendations from professors from your undergraduate major field of study are ideal. However if you have been out of school for a considerable time you should seek someone who can comment on your background, experiences, capacity to succeed and motivation. Employers, supervisors or other professionals are all appropriate choices while friends and family or fellow students are not.
* **What are the minimum GRE/GMAT scores required for admission?**  
  There are no minimum scores set by the Office of Graduate Admissions. We review the entire application file. For example, higher test scores may compensate for a lower GPA and vice versa.
* **Will my application be considered if I haven’t taken my GRE/GMAT/MAT/IELTS yet?**   
  Graduate Admissions does not review incomplete applications. All credentials must be submitted before an application is reviewed.
* **Do I need to submit GRE, GMAT or MAT scores if i already have a master’s degree?**  
  The GRE/GMAT/MAT may be waived for certain programs if a master’s degree or higher was awarded from an accredited United States college or university. It may also be waived for certain programs for applicants who submit an evaluation of their overseas coursework from a NACES member indicating a master’s degree or higher was earned. Please review our your [**program of interest page**](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/#/) for the most up to date information on whether the GRE/GMAT/MAT can be waived. Doctoral programs do not offer applicants waivers for the GRE.
* **Can I apply before I have graduated with my bachelor’s degree?**   
  Students who have not yet completed their undergraduate degree work may apply during their last term as undergraduates. An unofficial copy of your transcript may be submitted along with your application. After admission, a final, official transcript indicating that you have received your baccalaureate degree must be submitted to the Office of Graduate Admissions.
* **Do I have an advisor for my Master’s Degree/Certification program?**  
  The Graduate Program Coordinators (GPC) are a valuable resource who can help students in the early stages of exploring which program is right for them. The GPC will provide students with detailed information regarding an intended course of study. They will also help you with course selection, overall curriculum planning, research opportunities and career goals. Please refer to the list of [Graduate Program Coordinators](/graduate/about-school/graduate-program-coordinators/) to find the name and contact information for the GPC for your program. (*Please refer to the Doctoral Advisor bullet below for more information regarding the advisor process for doctoral students)*
* **Do I have an advisor if I am in a Doctoral Program?**  
  Yes, doctoral students have an advisor throughout their academic journey.

  Every Doctoral Program has a Doctoral Program Directors (DPD) who are responsible for managing all aspects of their Doctoral Program, however, they may not be your assigned advisor. Each program handles their advising process differently, so please refer below to each Doctoral program advising scheduling process:

  + [**Environmental Science and Management PhD**](https://www.montclair.edu/environmental-management-phd/people/): Prospective students must identify at least one member of the doctoral faculty who will agree to serve as their PhD advisor and mention it in their research statement during the application process.
  + [**Mathematics Education PhD**](https://www.montclair.edu/mathematics-education-phd/): Students are assigned a faculty advisor after they’re admitted.
  + [**Clinical Psychology PhD**](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/clinical-psychology-phd/) & **[Industrial/Organizational Psychology PhD](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/industrial-and-organizational-psychology-phd/):** Students should note what faculty mentors they prefer to work within the application. During the admissions interview stage, the department will begin to determine which faculty member you will be mentored by. When admission is offered, the faculty mentor is usually noted in the offer (the faculty and the student have to agree to it before committing). When admission is accepted and they create their MSU credentials, the Coordinator for Graduate Student Advancement adds that faculty member as the student’s FAC advisor in Banner which is reflected in DegreeWorks (this is typically done in July/August).
  + [Audiology (AuD)](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/audiology-aud): You would have a Graduate Advisor *(administrative staff member)* and a Graduate Program Coordinator *(faculty member)*.  The initial graduate advising starts with the Graduate Advisor and then any academic and/or personal issues are assigned to the GPC.
  + [**Teacher Education and Teacher Development (PhD)**](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/teacher-education-and-teacher-development-phd): *More information coming soon!*
  + [**Family Science and Human Development (PhD)**](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/family-science-human-development-phd): *More information coming soon!*
  + [Counseling (PhD)](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate/programs-of-study/phd-in-counseling): *More information coming soon!*
* **How long will you keep my application materials on file?** We will keep your application materials on file for two academic terms if you do not complete the application.
* **When and how do I know if I’ve been accepted?**  
  Once the application is complete, the Office of Graduate Admissions will conduct a preliminary review of all submitted materials. If the minimum admission requirements have been met, your application will then be forwarded for departmental review. Once an admission decision has been made, applicants will receive notification via email and will be able to access their official letter on their Portal. The length of this process varies by program but the Office of Graduate Admissions works to provide decisions in a timely manner.
* **Can I take courses as a non-degree student before being accepted into a program?**  
  It may be possible to take some courses before being accepted into a program, but not all courses may be available to students who are not already in a program. Please visit our [Non-Degree and Visiting Students](/graduate/how-to-apply/non-degree-and-visiting-students/) page for more information.

Uploading Unofficial Transcripts

* **What is the difference between an Official and an Unofficial Transcript?**  
  An official transcript is produced by an institution’s Registrar’s Office and is traditionally delivered to the receiving institution electronically or in a sealed envelope.  An official transcript sent to a student remains official provided that it remains in its original sealed envelope.
  + An unofficial transcript can appear in any of the following forms:
  + A downloaded version printed from a student portal.
  + An official transcript issued to the student that has been opened/removed from its original sealed envelope
  + A scanned copy of an official transcript
* **What does the Office of Graduate Admissions require me to submit?**  
  You are required to submit a transcript from every college/university that you’ve ever attended.  After submitting your application, we encourage you to submit unofficial transcripts, as that will expedite the time that it takes to process and complete your application.  
  After admission to your graduate program of study, an official transcript from each institution indicating degree conferment will be required.
* **What are acceptable copies of transcripts?**  
  Unofficial transcripts need to meet all of the guidelines below:
  + Every transcript must be uploaded as its own separate attachment.
  + Transcripts must be clearly legible and saved in PDF format.
  + Transcripts must contain your full name and the name of your institution.
  + Any sensitive information (e.g. SSN) must be redacted.
  + Transcripts must include all class history and grades, including those courses in progress.

  **Please note that unofficial transcripts must be scanned copies or downloaded directly from your institution; photos of transcripts are not accepted.  If scanning with a smartphone, we recommend using either [Adobe Scan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html) or [CamScanner.](https://www.camscanner.com/)**
* **How can I upload my unofficial transcript(s)?**  
  Upon submitting your application, you will have the ability to upload materials via your Applicant Status Portal.  Under your Application Checklist, you’ll notice checklist item(s) entitled “Transcript for School” for each institution that you listed in your academic history. Click on “Upload Materials” to get started.  From there, select “Unofficial Transcript” from the drop down menu, and select “Choose File”.  Select the document that you’d like to upload and click the “Upload” button to continue.  After uploading, you will notice that the document that you uploaded appears in the Application Checklist as “Unofficial Transcript”.  This will remain until the Office of Graduate Admissions has the opportunity to review and verify that your unofficial transcript(s) meet all of the requirements listed above (within 3 business days).  Once that verification takes place, your transcript will be labeled with the corresponding name of the institution and marked as “Received”; you will also receive an e-mail confirmation.
* **What do I do if I have any questions about my transcript or application?****The fastest way to reach us is via e-mail: [graduate@montclair.edu](mailto:graduate@montclair.edu).**

International Students

* **If I studied at an institution outside of the US, what educational background is needed to be eligible to apply to the Office of Graduate Admissions?**  
  The Office of Graduate Admissions requires the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor’s degree in order to apply to all programs, including non-degree study. The Office of Graduate Admissions does not evaluate international transcripts. Applicants with a non-U.S. degree must submit an official evaluation of all previous college and university records indicating U.S. degree equivalency and overall GPA. Course-by-course evaluations may be requested on a per student basis. Applicants to doctoral programs will be required to submit a course-by-course evaluation for earned degrees. This requirement cannot be waived. Official evaluations must be sent directly from any [**NACES member organization**](https://www.naces.org/members). Suggested evaluation services include: 
  + **[The Evaluation Company (TEC)](https://evalcompany.com/)**
  + **[Educational Perspectives](https://www.edperspective.org/)**
  + **[Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE)](https://www.ece.org/ECE/Credential-Evaluations/US-Institutions)**
  + **[International Education Evaluations (IEE)](https://myiee.org/university/montclair-state-university---graduate-school)**
  + Or any company recognized by **[NACES](https://www.naces.org/members)**
* **If my foreign transcripts are already translated into English, do I still need to have them evaluated?**  
  ALL foreign transcripts must receive an evaluation from **[NACES member organizations](https://www.naces.org/members)**.  Evaluations must include U.S. degree equivalency and overall GPA. You may provide your own evaluation, or be considered for an evaluation provided to a limited number of students by Montclair State University. Official evaluations are sent directly from any [NACES member organization](https://www.naces.org/members). Suggested evaluation services include: 
  + **[The Evaluation Company (TEC)](https://evalcompany.com/)**
  + **[Educational Perspectives](https://www.edperspective.org/)**
  + **[Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE)](https://www.ece.org/ECE/Credential-Evaluations/US-Institutions).**
  + **[International Education Evaluations (IEE)](https://myiee.org/university/montclair-state-university---graduate-school)**
  + Or any company recognized by **[NACES](https://www.naces.org/members)**

  Additional information regarding the transcript evaluation process can be found on the **[Graduate Transcript Evaluation Options and Process](https://www.montclair.edu/global/graduate-transcript-evaluation-options-and-process/)** webpage. **This requirement cannot be waived.**
* **Do I need to submit English Proficiency Testing?**  
  Yes. ALL international students, with the exception of those [eligible to receive a waiver](https://www.montclair.edu/global/how-to-apply/english-language-proficiency-test-requirement-exemptions/?wp_logged_in=true), must submit proof of English proficiency. Unofficial score reports are not accepted. Students must have official scores sent directly from the testing agency to Montclair State University. Information on approved testing and minimum required scores can be found on the [International Graduate Applicants website](https://www.montclair.edu/global/how-to-apply/graduate-students/?wp_logged_in=true).
* **Do I need to submit an enrollment deposit?**

  Yes. Effective January 27, 2025, we require ALL international F1/J1 seeking students to submit a $1,000 deposit upon admission. As an international student, our goal is to ensure that you are supported and provided the best opportunities when you arrive on campus. The deposit is credited toward payment of your first semester fees and is not an additional expense. Enrollment deposits are non-refundable UNLESS the student is denied the student visa AND only if the student attempted to obtain the visa using Montclair’s I-20. If you plan to attend in a future semester, the enrollment deposit can be applied to one future semester in a 12 month period (ex: if deferring from Spring 2025, you can apply your deposit to either Fall 2025 OR Spring 2026. You can no longer defer for more than one semester). Deferrals can only be processed after paying the deposit. If you are offered admission to one of our graduate programs, the deadline to submit your enrollment deposit is as follows:

  + - Spring: December 1st
    - Fall: July 1st

  No. Assistantship positions are highly competitive. Each department evaluates the students who have indicated interest in being considered for a position, and engages in a hiring process from there. If a department is interested in meeting with you regarding an available position, they will contact you directly. For Fall positions, departments can hire assistants any time from March through July. For Spring positions, departments can hire assistants any time from October through January. Hiring outside of these time frames occurs occasionally, in order to fill vacancies as necessary.
