**Hotel Address:** 308 W 58th St, New York, NY 10019 (This is located in Manhattan)  
**Phone:** +1-877-544-0935  
**Hotel Entrance Photo:**

**Hotel check-in:** Monday, July 6, 2026 beginning at 3 p.m.\*  
\*If you arrive early and are not able to check in, the hotel can hold your luggage at no cost while you explore the area.

We will depart from the hotel lobby for the opening reception/orientation at 5:45 p.m. Attendance is required.

**Hotel information:**

We will make reservations for tour members with a check-in on Monday afternoon and a check-out on Friday morning. If you are staying only for these nights, **NO ACTION is required**– we will reserve the room for you. Note that a credit card will be required upon arrival and expect that the hotel will require a monetary hold for any incidental charges.

Each participant will have their own room with a queen bed.  While the location of the hotel is unbeatable and the hotel facilities amazing, please let me dispel any hopes of a “large” room – the rooms are quite small.

**Additional hotel information:**

* Free in-room wi-fi access is available. There is no business center at the hotel, however the front desk can assist if you need to print any documents.
* The rooms have a minibar. Tour members would be responsible for any charges for use.
* There is a bar and a restaurant on-site and room service is available.
* The hotel does not have a gym.
* Coffee makers are not available in the room, however coffee is available in shops close to the hotel (a short walk).

**Room upgrades (larger rooms or an additional bed):**

No cots or additional beds can be added in the standard queen room that we have booked for you. If you plan to have another person(s) staying with you and want additional space, you may want to consider upgrading to a king room (one king bed) or a double deluxe room (two full beds). You would be responsible for the upgrade fee. The cost to upgrade to a 1 bed king room is tbd/night. The cost to upgrade to a 2 full bed double deluxe room is tbd/night. If you wish to upgrade your room, email [metronytour@gmail.com](mailto:metronytour@gmail.com) by **May 15** with the request. Please specify if you are requesting a king room or a double deluxe room and use the subject heading “upgrade requested.”

Note that we can’t accommodate any guests at visits/receptions – only tour members may participate in formal group activities.

**Additional hotel nights:**  
For those who might wish to spend additional unscheduled days in NYC, we are pleased to be able to accommodate you. Additional nights would be at your own expense. The rates noted below are valid for up to three days before and/or after the tour.

The charge for the standard queen room for additional nights is tbd/night (plus taxes). The cost for the upgraded king room for additional nights is tbd/night (plus taxes). The cost for the upgraded double deluxe room for additional nights is tbd/night (plus taxes). If you need additional nights to arrive prior to Monday or stay later than the Friday morning checkout, email us at [metronytour@gmail.com](mailto:metronytour@gmail.com) by **May 15** with this request. Please use the subject title “additional nights requested” and let us know your check-in and check-out dates.

Arrival and Departure Information

**Arrival information:**

Participants must arrive by the afternoon of **Monday, July 6, 2026,** for an orientation and opening reception. Hotel check-in begins at 3 p.m. and we will depart for the opening reception at 5:30 p.m.

**Departure information:**

Hotel check-out will be done prior to 7 a.m. on **Friday, July 10, 2026.** We strongly recommend that participants settle their hotel bills on Thursday night and only have to return their room key on Friday morning. Upon check-out, the group will depart together for the final university visit which will take place at Hofstra University from 9:30 a.m.-1 p.m. All tour members MUST attend this final visit and must plan departing transportation accordingly. Upon conclusion of this visit, we will offer a bus to the Lefferts Blvd. air train station for JFK airport for those departing on later afternoon/evening flights from there. After the JFK air train drop-off, the bus will also return to the hotel in Manhattan for those staying extra nights or departing via other locations/means that would be more easily accessed from Manhattan.

Those with flights on Friday, July 10, 2026 late afternoon/evening departing from LaGuardia (LGA) or Newark Liberty (EWR) will need to arrange for their own transportation from Hofstra or from the hotel at their own expense and must ensure that there is sufficient travel time between the Hofstra event concluding at 1 p.m. and their departure time.

**IMPORTANT: Please check your hotel receipt carefully before settling the bill. Resolve any issues directly with the hotel staff and if not possible, please contact your tour leader for assistance.**

Transportation Information

**Getting to and from NYC:**

The closest airport to Manhattan is LaGuardia (LGA). Other nearby airports are Newark Liberty (EWR) and JFK. Please take into account additional time for traffic/travel from the airport to the hotel when making reservations.

For any of you staying on the east coast, you may find some less expensive transportation alternatives via train or bus. Penn Station and Grand Central (trains) and Port Authority (buses) are all an easy ride away from us.

**Transportation to the hotel:**

If you need suggestions about transportation options to the hotel, please contact them directly at +1-877-544-0935.

**Inter-tour transportation:**

The tour will use a combination of private buses and public trains/subways. The private buses will be equipped with wi-fi and will have a toilet.

There is no need for you to worry about how to get to or from our various campus visits/activities, as one of our committee members will be staying with you at the hotel to accompany/lead you throughout the week.

* Refreshments (light hors d’oeuvres) at the opening reception and dinner at the closing reception

Evening Activities

There is a brief opening reception/orientation on Monday and a closing dinner on Thursday. Other nights will be unscheduled and we hope that you’ll enjoy taking advantage of the many fun things to see and do in NYC. We have noted anticipated arrival times on the tour schedule and would advise you to keep those in mind prior to booking any tickets.

Note that Broadway plays generally do not run on Monday nights. Please also note that the travel time back to the hotel on Wednesday could be unpredictable depending on traffic.

Dress Code&comma; Dietary Restrictions&comma; and Handouts

**Dress code: super casual and bring layers!**

Summer in the greater NYC area can be VERY hot and humid. However, the air conditioning on subways, buses and in indoor spaces can be the opposite extreme (i.e. REALLY COLD). Given that you will be indoors and outdoors (including tours of each campus), we encourage you to dress comfortably and casually and bring layers. *Read*: shorts and t-shirts are welcome for all events – including opening/closing receptions, but be sure to have layers for cold indoor spaces.

**Dietary and/or other restrictions:**

We have noted any dietary and/or other restrictions you indicated on your application form and will do our best to accommodate everyone. If you have any other restrictions that we should be aware of, please do let us know at: [metronytour@gmail.com](mailto:metronytour@gmail.com).

**Handouts:**

We are aware of your luggage restrictions, so we will not burden you with excessive brochures or handouts. We will provide you with an electronic tour manual which will have useful information about the universities on the tour and will have a section for notes, should you choose to print it yourself.

Opening Reception&sol;Tour Orientation and Closing Reception

**Opening reception/orientation: Monday, July 6, 2026:**

We will be going over some important information at the start of the reception and do request that you arrive in time to meet in the hotel for departure.

Fordham University-Lincoln Center  
Lowenstein Bldg.  
113W 60th Street  
Second Floor
