Insurance

Visiting scholars are required by the U.S. State Department to purchase medical insurance for themselves and any accompanying dependents. According to 22 CFR 62.14, all J-1 and J-2 Exchange Visitors are required to have and maintain health insurance that meets Department of State’s requirements. A summary of these insurance requirements is as follows:

1. Major medical benefits must be at least $100,000 for each accident or illness.
2. Repatriation of remains benefit must be at least $25,000.
3. Medical evacuation benefit must be at least $50,000.
4. The deductible for each accident or illness may not exceed $500.
5. Policy may not unreasonably exclude coverage for perils inherent to the activities of the exchange program.
6. Any policy, plan, or contract secured to fill the above requirements must, at a minimum, be:(1) Underwritten by an insurance corporation having an A.M. Best rating of “A¥” or above; a McGraw Hill Financial/Standard & Poor’s Claims-paying Ability rating of “A¥” or above; a Weiss Research, Inc. rating of “B+” or above; a Fitch Ratings, Inc. rating of “A¥” or above; a Moody’s Investor Services rating of “A3” or above; or such other rating as the Department of State may from time to time specify.

\*If you have insurance from your home country: The Department of State’s language regarding insurance from home is quite vague: “The policy must be backed by the full faith and credit of your home country government”. This means that your home country insurance must fully cover all your health needs while you are in the United States. Most would not, so you should check this prior to your arrival.

**\* Insurance documents** **must be in English and US Dollars**

**Please note that U.S. government subsidized insurance cannot be used for the waiver.**
