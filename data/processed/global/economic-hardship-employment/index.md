# Economic Hardship Employment

In some instances, a student who is able to prove severe economic hardship caused by circumstances beyond their control, which arose after obtaining the F-1 students status, may be eligible for permission to work off-campus.

Students must have been in student status for one full academic year, and must be able to document the circumstances causing the economic need including not being able to find on-campus employment. If authorized, employment is limited to no more than 20 hours per week when school is in session and full-time during the break or vacation periods.

Applications must be endorsed by OGE and submitted to USCIS for approval. This application may take up to 90 days to process. **All students must meet with an [OGE advisor](https://www.montclair.edu/global/appointments/?wp_logged_in=true) before they can apply for severe economic hardship.**

## Application Process

Below is a checklist of the items you will need to prepare in order to file an application for severe economic hardship employment with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

OGE must issue a new Form I-20 indicating a recommendation for severe economic hardship employment, which you will need before sending your application to USCIS.

Issuance of a new Form I -20 recommending severe economic hardship employment authorization is not an approval and does not guarantee employment authorization will be approved by USCIS.

THE FOLLOWING ITEMS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED TO U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES (USCIS) AFTER YOU RECEIVE YOUR NEW FORM I-20 WITH THE EMPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION:

* Economic Hardship endorsed I-20 issued by OGE
* COMPLETED [FORM G-1145](https://www.uscis.gov/g-1145) (E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance).
* COMPLETED [FORM I-765](https://www.uscis.gov/i-765). (Must be mailed)
  + Complete item #27 with the appropriate Eligibility Category code: (c)(3)(iii)
* FILING FEE PAYMENT OF $520.00 (See USCIS guidelines for paying fees).
  + Option 1: Personal Check or Money Order, payable to “U.S. Department of Homeland Security”
  + Option 2: Credit Card Payment Form G-1450 (check carefully for errors and sign in the appropriate field)
  + In some circumstances, students may qualify for a filing fee waiver. Additional information on filing a fee waiver: [USCIS fee waivers](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees/additional-information-on-filing-a-fee-waiver)
* TWO (2) PHOTOGRAPHS. These must meet the requirements outlined on page 20 of USCIS’s Instructions for Form I-765.
  + It is recommended that students write their full name, date of birth and I-94 number in pencil or felt pen on the back of each photograph. The photos should be cut by the photo establishment.
* DOCUMENTATION
  + Students must write a letter to USCIS explaining the circumstances causing the economic need – why have your financial circumstances changed? What happened to your sponsor’s funds?
  + Provide a detailed breakdown of your annual expenses, including tuition and fees, living costs, and miscellaneous expenses. Additionally, submit an overview of your current sources of funding.
  + *Students must submit both of these documents to OGE for review when requesting the Form I-20.*
* PHOTOCOPIES OF EACH OF THE FOLLOWING:
  + Form I-94 (I-94 card copied front and back OR I-94 electronic record printed from <https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov>)
  + F-1 visa stamp (OR I-797 Approval Notice from USCIS if applicable)
  + Passport personal information page(s) and passport validity page showing expiration date.
  + All previously issued Forms I-20 (including the newest I-20 recommending economic hardship employment).
  + Previous Employment Authorization Documents (EADs), front and back, if applicable

**MAKE A COPY OF YOUR COMPLETE APPLICATION FOR YOUR OWN IMMIGRATION RECORDS BEFORE MAILING IT TO USCIS.**
