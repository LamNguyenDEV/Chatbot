# Costs, Scholarships, and Assistantships

Montclair State University remains committed to making education affordable for all international students, regardless of their country of origin. As a public institution, we cannot administer need-based financial aid to international students. Unless awarded a merit-based scholarship or assistantship, international students must plan to pay the entire cost of attending Montclair State University. International students on F-1 on J-1 status will be charged out-of-state tuition.

Scholarships for Undergraduate Freshmen

Montclair State University offers merit-based scholarships to freshman international students.

Qualified students can receive our [Presidential Scholarship](https://www.montclair.edu/admissions/cost-and-financial-aid/scholarships/?wp_logged_in=true).

This scholarship is renewable for up to 4 years and is offered to students who meet certain GPA criteria. Students who qualify will be automatically awarded this prestigious scholarship.

Students will be required to maintain a minimum GPA to continue to receive this award. More information is provided upon acceptance.

Assistantships for Graduate Students

A limited number of assistantships are available for master’s and PhD. students. Students interested in applying for an assistantship for the fall must complete their application prior to March 1. Assistantships for spring are limited.

Please note that assistantships are highly competitive. Students should be prepared to finance their own education through personal/family/sponsor funds or loans obtained in their home country.

## Cost of Attendance

The federal government requires Montclair State University to verify that prospective students have sufficient funds to be able to live and study in the U.S. for their first year of study before being issued a Form I-20. F-1 students are required to take a full-time course load each fall and spring semester (12 credits for undergraduate, 9 credits for master’s, doctorate, and 6 credits for Artist Diploma or Performer’s Certificate).

Refer to our [Estimated Costs](https://www.montclair.edu/global/estimated-i-20-expenses) page for a full list of current costs by program. These costs reflect the minimum cost of living in the U.S. and studying at Montclair State University for 9 months (one academic year). These estimates do not include the cost of living and studying in the summer; if you plan to remain in the U.S. during the summer, you will need to ensure that you have additional funds for tuition and fees, living expenses, and miscellaneous expenses.

If your program is longer than one academic year, please project the funding that you will need for the following years by planning for an **overall increase of 2-3% per year.**
