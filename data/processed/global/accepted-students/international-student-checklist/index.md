# F-1 Accepted International Student Checklist

Congratulations on your admission! Now that you’ve been accepted to Montclair State University, complete the steps below to enroll as a full-fledged Red Hawk!

Step 1

Know Your Campus-Wide ID &lpar;CWID&rpar;

Your Campus-Wide ID (CWID) and PIN are your keys to becoming a Montclair State University student.

**All Students:** You will find your CWID in your acceptance letter in your application portal. You will use the CWID to confirm your identity when activating your NetID.

* [Undergraduate application portal](https://apply.montclair.edu/portal/nextsteps)
* [Graduate application portal](http://graduate.montclair.edu/status)

Questions about this step? Undergraduate students: contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at [973-655-4444](tel:973-655-4444) or email [msuadm@montclair.edu](mailto:msuadm@montclair.edu) for assistance. Graduate students: contact Graduate Admissions at [973-655-5147](http://973-655-5147) or email [graduate@montclair.edu](mailto:graduate@montclair.edu) for assistance.

Step 2

Submit Your I-20 Application and Required Documents

**To apply for an F-1 visa or to transfer your existing F-1 record, you are required to apply for a Form I-20. The enrollment deposit is NOT required to apply for the I-20.**

* Step 1: Thoroughly read information about [how to apply for the I-20](https://www.montclair.edu/global/how-to-apply-for-a-form-i-20/) and prepare your financial documents accordingly.
* Step 2: Complete the “[Application for I-20 and Affidavit of Support](https://www.montclair.edu/global/how-to-apply-for-a-form-i-20/)” document.
  + DO NOT HANDWRITE-only the signatures can be handwritten (note: an electronic signature can be used in lieu of a “wet” signature). All other fields must be typed.
* Step 3: Access your admissions portal to upload the documents.
  + [Undergraduate student admissions portal](https://apply.montclair.edu/portal/admissions)
  + [Graduate student admissions portal](http://graduate.montclair.edu/status)
* Step 4: Upload documents to the corresponding checklist items:
  + **Passport**: upload a copy of the biographical page of your passport.
  + **Financial Documents:** combine all financial documents into one PDF. If you have received an assistantship or scholarship, please note the amount on the affidavit and upload financial documents showing sufficient funds to cover the remaining balance.
  + **[Application for I-20 and Affidavit of Support](https://www.montclair.edu/global/how-to-apply-for-a-form-i-20/):** combine all signed affidavits and the application into one PDF. If living off-campus for free with a friend or family member, upload the [Affidavit of Free Room and Board form](https://www.montclair.edu/global/how-to-apply-for-a-form-i-20/) and supporting documentation to this same checklist item as one PDF.

**IMPORTANT:**

* Carefully consider your financials before submitting-we will not accommodate requests for changes to the I-20 funding.
* Ensure that you are uploading these three documents into the three separate checklist items with the corresponding names. If uploaded correctly, a green check-mark will appear next to each of the three items within 24 hours. If any red “x’s” remain, there is a problem and you must re-submit the missing item(s).

Example of properly uploaded financial documents for I-20 purposes:

Please allow at least 5-10 business days (business days are Monday through Friday) to review your application. If additional documentation is required, we will contact you via email. If your documents are approved, you will receive an email with instructions about how to download the I-20 from your application portal.

Do **NOT** email documents to us and there is no need to email to confirm that the documents have been uploaded. Access your application portal to confirm proper upload.

**Students who are already in the U.S. with an active F-1 status:**

* Submit the [Application for I-20 and Affidavit of Support](https://www.montclair.edu/global/how-to-apply-for-a-form-i-20/) and the required documents noted per the procedure above.
* You must have the international student advisor at your current university release your SEVIS record to us. 
  + Please contact the international student advisor at your current institution for information about how to transfer your SEVIS record to Montclair State University as each university has a different internal process. Montclair does not have a “transfer-in” form or any documentation required on our end. You will most likely need to provide your current international advisor a copy of your Montclair State University acceptance letter which you can access in your application portal.
  + Montclair’s F-1 School Code is NEW214F01039000.
  + Your I-20 will be issued after your current university releases your SEVIS record to Montclair State University.

**UPON ISSUANCE OF THE I-20:**

* Please check the I-20 to ensure that there are no errors.
* Refer to our [“Understanding your I-20” page](https://www.montclair.edu/global/current-students/f-1-students/understanding-your-i-20) for information about what is and is not included on this document and frequently asked questions (example: the name of your major on the I-20 vs. your Montclair major).

Step 4

Set Up Your NET ID and Montclair Email Account

**Your NetID is your Montclair email account login ID and your login for other web-based University systems.**

1-3 days after receipt of your enrollment deposit, you will receive an email and/or notification of an update to your portal which will contain your NetID and instructions for setting it up. As part of activating your NetID, you’ll have to confirm your identity through a challenge question. **As a new student, you must choose the “CWID” challenge question.** Your NetID cannot be activated until your enrollment deposit has been processed.

After you activate your NetID, use your NetID and newly established password to access [nest.montclair.edu](http://nest.montclair.edu/), your Gmail, and other University systems. Note that it may take 24 hours until you’re able to successfully log in to other campus systems after setting up your NetID.

**Please Note:** When you first log in to any of Montclair’s systems that use your NetID, you will be prompted to activate your MFA (Multi-factor Authentication).

**Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):**

You will need to install the Duo Mobile App. For more information about how to install and use MFA, review the [Duo Authentication page](https://www.montclair.edu/information-technology/duo-mfa-enrollment-usage-guide/).

**Your Montclair Email Account:**  
To access your Montclair email, visit [gmail.com](https://www.gmail.com/) and type in your NetID@montclair.edu and your NetID password. Don’t forget to add your new Montclair email to your phone and check it regularly! As a newly admitted student, you may receive emails to your personal email, your Montclair email, or both.

Step 6

Submit the DS-160 Form and Schedule Your Visa Appointment

Complete the online application form DS-160 (some applicants will also be required to submit a form DS-157). All forms must be completed and signed, and can be found at <http://evisaforms.state.gov/default.asp>. A separate form is needed for children, even if they are included in their parent’s passport.

* When filling out the DS-160 the university address can be found on the I-20 (1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, NJ 07043, USA)
* The contact person is the staff member (DSO) that signed your I-20.
* The email is I-20@montclair.edu
* The phone number is: (+1) 973-655-6862

Visit [http://www.usembassy.gov](http://www.usembassy.gov/) to locate the embassy or consulate near you to schedule your required visa appointment.  Wait times for an appointment can be lengthy so apply as soon as possible upon receiving your I-20. Please note due to recent changes made by the Department of State, check with your local embassy/consulate about visa issuance guidelines in your country.

As you prepare for your visa appointment, you may wish to contact an EducationUSA Advising Center in your home country. The [EducationUSA Advising Center](https://educationusa.state.gov/) can give you helpful information about application procedures specific to your home country. If possible, you may want to attend a pre-departure orientation program organized by the center. This orientation will likely include information not only about applying for the visa, but also about American culture.  We also recommend that you review [NAFSA’s 10 Points to Remember](https://montclair-isss.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=13346) to prepare for your visa interview.

Prepare the following documents for the visa interview at your local U.S. embassy or consulate:

* Passport valid for up to 6 months past the intended end date on your I-20
* I-20
* Admission letter from Montclair State University
* Receipt of SEVIS fee payment
* Documented proof of financial support
* Test scores and academic records
* 2×2 visa photo (for specific requirements visit: [https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/general/photos.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos.html))
* Additional documents as required by the embassy or consulate (check your home country’s embassy or consulate for more information)

Canadian Students**\***

* Canadian citizens are not required to obtain a visa to enter the United States; however, they must obtain an I-20 and pay the SEVIS fee before entering the US.
* The following documents must be presented to the customs officer either at the border or airport:

  + Valid passport
  + Admission letter from Montclair State University
  + Receipt of SEVIS fee payment
  + Documented proof of financial support
  + I-20

**\****Permanent residents* of Canada are required to obtain a visa before entering the United States.

**Please inform us of the outcome of your visa interview so that we can update our records: [I-20@montclair.edu](mailto:I-20@montclair.edu).**

Step 7

Pay the SEVIS fee

The SEVIS fee, also known as the Federal SEVIS I-901 fee, is a mandatory fee that must be paid by student and exchange visitors before applying for an F-1. The fee is $350 for the F-1 visa. The fee can be paid by credit card, Western Union Quick Pay, or by mail.  We do not recommend paying the fee by mail for it might take as long as four weeks to be processed. To pay the fee online, follow these instructions:

* Visit [http://www.fmjfee.com](http://www.fmjfee.com/)
* Complete the form I-901. Be sure that you enter your personal information exactly as it appears on your I-20.
* The Montclair State University school code is: NEW214F01039000
* The SEVIS ID number is printed on the top left of your I-20. The SEVIS number starts with the letter N.
* Once you have paid using a credit card, print the receipt. Do not exit the receipt page until you print the receipt. You will not be able to return to the receipt page once closed.

A prospective F student with a country of citizenship or who was born in Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, or Gambia must pay by money order, Western Union Quick Pack, or certified check drawn from a U.S. bank.

SEVP will accept third party payments, meaning someone else can pay your I-901 SEVIS fee for you. For students who cannot pay the fee by credit card, third party payers are also restricted from paying the fee by credit card. For instructions on how to complete the Western Union Quick pay/Quick Collect form, please visit: <https://www.ice.gov/sevis/i901/wu-instructions>

Step 8

Complete Mandatory Health&sol;Immunization Requirements

Within 48 hours of activating your NetID (step 4 of the checklist), you will be able to access the [MyHealthPortal](https://www.montclair.edu/student-health-center/my-health/?) to upload your vaccination records. Immunization Requirements for Montclair students are [viewable here](https://www.montclair.edu/student-health-center/immunizations/requirements/?).

**Submit all immunization documentation** through [MyHealthPortal](https://www.montclair.edu/student-health-center/my-health/?). (Please note, requests for medical exemption must be uploaded to [MyHealthPortal](https://www.montclair.edu/student-health-center/my-health/?) as well.) [Learn more about how to submit your immunization forms](https://www.montclair.edu/student-health-center/immunizations/how-to-submit-immunization-forms/?).

International students who do not have access to their individual vaccination certificates and/or they are not available in English may have their doctor complete this form to verify vaccination information.

[International Student Immunization Form](http://www.montclair.edu/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/116/2025/05/Immunization-Form-International-Students-updated-2.pdf)

* **Spring Students**: The deadline to submit immunization records is December 1st or three weeks from the date you pay your deposit.
* **Fall Students**: If you submit your deposit by May 1st, the deadline for submitting immunization records is May 22nd. If you pay your deposit after May 1st, you have three weeks from the date of deposit payment to submit the form.

**Don’t delay! You may be de-registered from your courses if your vaccination records aren’t received by [posted deadlines](https://www.montclair.edu/student-health-center/immunizations/?).**

If you need help, contact the Student Health Center at [973-655-3459](tel:9736553459)or by email to [askanurse@montclair.edu](mailto:askanurse@montclair.edu). Office hours are on the weekdays from 8am-5:30pm.

Step 9

Complete Mandatory Insurance Requirements

Per university policy, all full and part time international students are required to have sufficient health care insurance.

* Montclair State University will enroll **all full and part time F-1 international students** into the [school-sponsored health insurance plan](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/student-accounts/student-health-insurance/).
* Typically, we will not support plans marketed solely to international students as they do not fall in the category as accepted comparable alternative coverage (please verify before purchase). They are often not filed and approved in the U.S. and have limited benefits, provider networks and coverage periods that do not comply with the requirements of acceptable coverage per the Montclair State insurance mandate. GBG Insurance, HDL Global Specialty, ISO, PGH (United), PSI, Student Medicover and Tata AIG are examples of companies that do not meet the waiver requirements. For more information see [here](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/student-accounts/student-health-insurance/).
* International students can request an International Student Waiver Form by contacting [**University Health Plans**](http://universityhealthplans.com/montclair) at 800-437-6448 or [**info@univhealthplans.com**](mailto:info@univhealthplans.com). **Government subsidized insurance cannot be used for the waiver.**

Questions about this step? Contact University Health Plans via email at [info@univhealthplans.com](mailto:info@univhealthplans.com) for assistance.

**Once enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan, students can access their insurance card [here.](https://www.aetnastudenthealth.com/en/school/686164/members/get-id-card.html)**

Step 10

**Graduate students:**

In addition to mandatory in-person international [graduate orientation](https://www.montclair.edu/global/international-student-orientation/), you may be requested or required to join additional orientation programs for graduate students and/or your college/program.

* Questions about the mandatory in-person graduate international orientation? Email [oge@montclair.edu](mailto:oge@montclair.edu)
