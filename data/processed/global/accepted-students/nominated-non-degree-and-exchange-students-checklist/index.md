# Nominated Non-Degree and Exchange Student Checklist

**For NOMINATED Non-Degree International Students**

**This page is for non-degree students who have been admitted to Montclair State for one or two semesters through a partnership program.  This includes International Exchange Students and International Visiting Students.  
(\*For the Disney College Program, please refer to [Disney Checklist](https://www.montclair.edu/business/disney-checklist/)).**

Congratulations on your acceptance as a non-degree student to Montclair State University! We want you to have an easy transition to Montclair State and we hope this checklist will help as you prepare to arrive on campus.

Please read the checklist carefully and follow all the necessary steps.

The [Office of Global Engagement](http://www.montclair.edu/global/) team at Montclair State University is available to assist you through every stage of the journey from nomination to completing your semester or year here on campus.

Step 1

Know Your Campus Wide ID &lpar;CWID&rpar; and NetID

Your Campus-Wide ID (CWID) and NetID are your keys to becoming a Montclair State student.

They were assigned to you when you were accepted to the University. You will find your CWID and NetID in your acceptance letter.

Questions about this step? Misplaced your CWID or NetID? Contact [973-655-4185](mailto:973-655-4185) or email [studyabroad@montclair.edu](mailto:studyabroad@montclair.edu) for assistance.

Step 2

Activate Your NetID

Your NetID is your Montclair State email account login ID and your ID for other web-based University systems (NEST). You can establish (claim) your NetID on the [NetID Website](https://iams-amc.montclair.edu/page-intro). As part of activating your NetID, you’ll have to confirm your identity through a challenge question. **As a new student, you must choose the “CWID” challenge question.** Your NetID cannot be activated until your enrollment deposit has been processed.

After you activate your NetID, use your NetID and newly established password to access [nest.montclair.edu](http://nest.montclair.edu/), your Gmail, and other University systems.

It may take 24 hours until you’re able to successfully log in to other campus systems after setting up your NetID.

**Your Montclair Email Account:**  
To access your Montclair email, visit [gmail.com](https://www.gmail.com/) and type in your NetID@montclair.edu and your NetID password. Don’t forget to add your new Montclair email to your phone and check it regularly! As a newly admitted student, you may receive emails to your personal email, your Montclair email, or both.

**Please Note:** When you first log in to any of Montclair’s systems that use your NetID, you will be prompted to activate your MFA (Multi Factor Authentication). For more information on how to do this, review the [MFA Quick Reference Guide](https://www.montclair.edu/information-technology/wp-content/uploads/sites/168/2023/10/MFA-Quick-Reference-Guide-v2.pdf?). For your reference, here’s a [full list of SSO-enabled applications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zj1KAdMfLmlccxHBRjgfJf8gu8G0uWjznm-lAQjycr8/edit)that will require MFA to protect your privacy.

It may take 24 hours until you’re able to successfully log in to other campus systems after setting up your NetID.

Questions about this step? Contact [973-655-4185](mailto:973-655-4185) or email [studyabroad@montclair.edu](mailto:studyabroad@montclair.edu) for assistance.

* Email all documents to [oge@montclair.edu](mailto:oge@montclair.edu)

Please allow at least 10 business days (business days are Monday through Friday) to review your application. After it is reviewed, we will contact you by email (from [**oge@montclair.edu)**](mailto:oge@montclair.edu) with a status update, requesting additional information if needed. If approved, please follow the emailed instructions on how to download your DS-2019.

**Students who are already in the U.S. on active J-1 status:**

* Submit the [DS-2019 Application/Affidavit of Financial Resources](http://www.montclair.edu/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/116/2023/02/2023-24-DS2019-Affidavit.pdf) and the required documents noted per the procedure above.

Step 5

Pay the SEVIS Fee After You Receive Your DS-2019

The SEVIS fee, also known as the Federal SEVIS I-901 fee, is a mandatory fee that must be paid by student and exchange visitors before applying for a J-1 visa. The fee is $220 for the J-1 visa. The fee can be paid by credit card, Western Union Quick Pay, or by mail. We **do not** recommend paying the fee by mail for it might take as long as four weeks to be processed. To pay the fee online, follow these instructions:

* Visit <http://www.fmjfee.com>
* Complete the form I-901. Be sure that you enter your personal information **exactly** as it appears on your DS-2019
* For DS-2019 holders, the Montclair State University program number: **P105419**
* The SEVIS ID number is printed at the top right-hand corner of your DS-2019. The SEVIS number starts with the letter N.
* Once you have paid using a credit card, **print the receipt**. Do not exit the receipt page until you print the receipt. You will not be able to return to the receipt page once closed.

SEVP will accept third-party payments, meaning someone else can pay your I-901 SEVIS fee for you. For students who cannot pay the fee by credit card, third-party payers are also restricted from paying the fee by credit card. For instructions on how to complete the Western Union Quick pay/Quick Collect form, please visit: <https://www.ice.gov/sevis/i901/wu-instructions>

Step 6

Apply for J-1 Visa

Complete the online application form DS-160 (some applicants will also be required to submit a form DS-157). All forms must be completed and signed, and can be found at <http://evisaforms.state.gov/default.asp>. A separate form is needed for children, even if they are included in their parent’s passport. **PLEASE NOTE**: When filling out the DS-160, enter the contact information listed in section 7 of your DS-2019 under *contact person* and type Montclair State University under *Organization Name*.

Visit <http://www.usembassy.gov> to locate the embassy or consulate near you to schedule your required visa appointment. Wait times for an appointment can be lengthy so apply **as soon as possible** upon receiving your DS-2019.

As you prepare for your visa appointment, you may wish to contact an EducationUSA Advising Center in your home country. See <http://www.educationusa.info> for more information. The EducationUSA Advising Center can give you helpful information about application procedures specific to your home country. If possible, you may want to attend a pre-departure orientation program organized by the center. This orientation will likely include information not only about applying for the visa, but also about American culture.

**Prepare your Documents for Your Interview**

Provide the following documents to the U.S. embassy or consulate at the interview:

Step 8

Ensure Adequate Health Insurance Coverage

**Ensure adequate health insurance coverage.** All full-time Montclair State students are required to have health insurance coverage. Montclair State will automatically enroll you in the [Student Health Insurance Plan](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/managing-your-academic-life/student-health-insurance/) provided through the University. If you have private health insurance coverage that meets the U.S. Department of State’s requirements then you can waive this enrollment by showing proof of other insurance.

**Once enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan, students can access their insurance card [here.](https://www.aetnastudenthealth.com/en/school/686164/members/get-id-card.html)**

Major medical benefits must be at least $100,000 for each accident or illness.  
Repatriation of remains benefit must be at least $25,000.  
Medical evacuation benefit must be at least $50,000.  
The deductible for each accident or illness may not exceed $500.  
Policy may not unreasonably exclude coverage for perils inherent to the activities of the exchange program.

You can waive the enrollment and health insurance premium fee by providing the following information:

* The policy must also be in English
* All amounts must be listed in US dollars
* Policy documents must show dates of coverage
* **Government subsidized insurance cannot be used for the waiver**

You can find information about the Health Insurance Waiver here: [HEALTH INSURANCE WAIVER-J1](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/student-accounts/student-health-insurance/?).

Step 9
