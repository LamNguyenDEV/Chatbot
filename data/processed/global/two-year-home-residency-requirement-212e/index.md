# Two year Home Residency Requirement â€“ 212(e)

In some cases, the J-1 visa carries with it a two-year home residence requirement which obliges visa holders and their J-2 dependents to return to their home countries for two years before being eligible to apply for an immigrant visa or a non-immigrant H or L visa. The requirement also makes J-1 visa holders and their J-2 dependents ineligible to change to any other visa status within the United States if they are subject to it.

Not all J-1 visa holders are subject to this requirement. The requirement applies to those individuals in one of the following situations:

* J-1 visa holders who are funded by the United States government, their own governments, or international organizations during part or all of their stay in the United States are subject to the requirement.
* J-1 visa holders whose skills are needed in their home countries, as registered on the [Exchange Visitor Skills List,](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/skill-list-by-country.html) are subject to the requirement.
* J-1 visa holders who are graduates of foreign medical schools participating in internships, residencies, or clinical training programs in the United States sponsored by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) are subject to the requirement.
