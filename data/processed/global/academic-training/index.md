# Academic Training

Academic training is the name the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program uses for off-campus employment or practical experience related to your field of study. It is fairly flexible and offers a variety of paid and unpaid, full-time (more than 20 hours per week) or part-time (up to 20 hours per week), training or employment situations, with one or more employers, to supplement your academic program in the U.S. Students must receive separate academic training authorization for every paid or unpaid employment opportunity.

Academic training is available at any stage of your academic program, either while you are enrolled in school or after you complete your academic program. As long as you maintain valid J-1 status, follow the appropriate application and approval procedures, and stay within the stated time limits, you qualify for academic training.

If you are considering academic training, your authorization must be processed before your official academic program completion date. In addition, the academic training must begin within the first 30 days after the official academic program completion date.

Always study full-time

Enroll for and complete a full-time study course load (12 credits for undergraduate students, 9 credits for graduate students, 6 credits for students in the Artist’s Diploma and Performer’s Certificate programs) every fall and spring semester.

Undergraduate students: You are required to enroll in at least 9 credits in person (face-to-face or hybrid) each semester.

Graduate students: You are required to enroll in at least 6 credits in person (face-to-face or hybrid) each semester.

You must always have at least one in-person class (face-to-face or hybrid) in your final semester, *even if it’s during the summer term!*

Eligibility Criteria

You are eligible for academic training if all of the following criteria are met:

* You are in the U.S. primarily for study in a full-time academic program.
* You are in good academic standing at your educational institution.
* You must apply before the completion of your academic program.
* You are participating in academic training that is directly related to your major field of study.
* Your employment/training must take place with the specific employer or employers who are noted on the academic training authorization letter.
* You must receive an authorization letter, in advance, for the duration and type of academic training, from the Office of Global Engagement office. This authorization must be processed before the end date on the Form DS-2019 or before the official date of the degree program completion, whichever comes first.
* You have a valid Form DS-2019 that enables you to remain in the U.S. in J-1 student status. You must apply for extensions as needed and in a timely manner.
* You must maintain health insurance coverage for yourself and any dependents. Your coverage must meet the minimum requirements set by the Department of State.

Length of Academic Training

* Students who complete a degree program are permitted an overall academic training period of 18 months. This includes all academic training, whether before or after completion of studies.
* The total employment period may not exceed the amount of time spent in the full course of study. For example, if you are a master’s student who completed a program in 12 months, you are only eligible for 12 months of academic training. Doctoral students may be granted a total of 36 months of academic training in periods of 18 months or less.
* Completing more than one degree program at the same time does not increase your academic training period.
* Any pre-completion academic training period is deducted from your total allowable academic training period when calculating post-completion academic training.
* A period spent in part-time employment under academic training will count as full-time academic training and will be deducted from the 18 or 36 months of post-completion academic training.

Types of Academic Training

Students can apply for academic training before or after they complete his studies:

**Pre-completion academic training**

* Students apply for pre-completion academic training before they finish their academic program.
* It can be paid or unpaid.
* Students must maintain full-time enrollment during the spring and fall semesters.
* Part-time academic training is counted as full-time.

Any amount of time of pre-completion academic training will be deducted from the overall allotment.

**Post-completion academic training**

* Employment after your program completion must be for wages or another type of remuneration. If the proposed employment is unpaid, you must show that you are supported by other sources, like your home government.
* Employment must start within 30 days of your program completion date.
