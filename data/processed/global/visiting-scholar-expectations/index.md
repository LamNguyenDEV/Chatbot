2. Comply with all university regulations.
3. Deliver presentations, meet with classes or student groups that share common characteristics or interests, participate as a guest speaker within the scholarâ€™s disciplines, or in courses related to language and culture.
4. Regularly be present on campus and meet with your faculty mentor.
5. Actively pursue opportunities to learn about U.S. culture.
6. Submit a report on achievements, presentations and research efforts to the faculty host and the Office of Global Engagement prior to your departure.
