# Pre-Arrival Information

## Welcome to Montclair State University!

The staff of the Office of Global Engagement is excited to meet you and introduce you to your new home. We hope that your stay here will be a rewarding and enjoyable experience for you. We have put together some tips as you plan your trip to the U.S. Please contact us if you have further questions after reading this information.

10 Points to Remember When Applying for a Student Visa

1. Be prepared to prove strong ties to your home country.
2. Practice your interview in English – visa interviews are conducted in English.
3. Speak for yourself – do not bring others with you to your visa interview.
4. Know the program that you are planning to attend and how it fits your career/educational goals.
5. Be brief when answering questions at the visa interview.
6. Make sure any additional documentation you have is concise.
7. When it comes to visas, not all countries are viewed equally.
8. Your main purpose in coming to the United States should be to study or do scholarly work, not to work before or after graduation if you are a student.
9. If your spouse and children are remaining behind in your country, be prepared to address how they will support themselves in your absence.
10. Maintain a positive attitude.

Arriving in the U&period;S&period;

**New Jersey Climate and What to Pack:**

New Jersey has variable climates: cold winters with periodic snowfalls, humid summers, and some very pleasant periods in between. Warm jackets, scarves, hats, gloves, and boots are essential for winter (November-March). Waterproof outwear and umbrellas are essential in rainy weather. You may also want to bring small personal items, such as photographs, traditional dress, or other items to personalize your new home. Keep in mind residence halls have limited space. It is best to purchase electrical appliances after you arrive in the U.S., as appliances manufactured outside the U.S. may not be compatible with the power supply.

It is advisable to carry a small amount of U.S. cash, in paper currency and coins, for baggage carts, bus/train fares, and tips. Most airports have currency conversion stations for this purpose.

**When to Enter the U.S.:**

When purchasing your plane ticket, please note the start date on your I-20 or DS-2019. You are allowed to enter the United States **no more than 30 days before the reporting date** listed on your I-20 or DS-2019. You should not enter the United States after the start date listed on the I-20 or DS-2019. If you are facing unexpected delays, please notify our office as soon as possible to discuss your options.

**Important Documents to carry with you on the plane in your personal item:**

* Passport
* Original I-20 or DS-2019 (the immigration officer at the embassy or consulate may have put this in a sealed envelope or stapled it to your passport. Do not open; the officer at the airport will open it)
* Payment receipt of I-901 SEVIS Fee
* Evidence of financial support
* In the event that the officer needs to verify information with your school or program, you can call campus police at 973-655-5222 and they will contact the Office of Global Engagement on your behalf.

**Inside the Terminal: I-94 Arrival/Departure Record:**

Once inside the airport terminal, proceed to the immigration booth, and present your passport and your I-20 or DS-2019.  Expect to have your index fingers scanned for fingerprint purposes and a digital photograph taken, as required by regulations. The officer will stamp your passport for duration of status (D/S) and the date you entered the U.S.  The officer will create an electronic I-94 record for duration of status (D/S) and the date you entered the U.S. You can access your I-94 online immediately at **[https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/ "get I-94 record online")**‎. When you are able to check it, be sure the I-94 has the appropriate visa status (F-1 or J-1).  In certain cases, if there is a problem with your documents, you may be issued a 30-day entry and issued a form I-515, with instructions to see your international student advisor. If you receive this form, please email [oge@montclair.edu](mailto:oge@montclair.edu) upon your arrival.

If you are traveling by land, you will be distributed an I-94 Arrival-Departure Record Form, before arriving. It is a long white card and students complete the top and bottom sections of the form. Complete the form accurately. Make sure your name, date of birth, and citizenship matches exactly as it is written in your passport. If you do not understand a form, ask an attendant for assistance.

**Secondary Inspection Requirements:**

If the officer at the port of entry cannot initially verify your information, or you do not have all of the required documentation, you may be directed to an interview area known as “secondary inspection.” Secondary inspection allows inspectors to conduct additional research in order to verify information, without causing delays for other arriving passengers.  The officer will first attempt to verify your status by using the Student and Exchange and Visitor Information System (SEVIS). In the event that the officer needs to verify information with your school or program, you can call campus police at 973-655-5222 and they will contact the Office of Global Engagement on your behalf.

Getting to Campus

We strongly recommend that you arrange your airline flights so that you arrive at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), which is the closest airport to campus, as John F. Kennedy International Airport (located in New York State) will require a lengthy drive to campus. We also strongly recommend you take a taxi from the airport.

Please consider your flight arrival time and allow 1 1/2 hours to clear immigration and customs, receive your baggage, and locate your transport. Travel times by car from Newark Liberty International Airport to campus, depending on the time of the day, will be approximately 30 minutes, whereas travel time from the John F. Kennedy International Airport can be up to 2 hours.

**From Newark International Airport (EWR)**

**By Taxi:**

* The cost will be approximately $50-$100 USD, including the customary driver’s tip. Cost should be arranged with the driver before leaving the airport.
* Ask the taxi driver to take you to:
  + **If your housing assignment is in the Village at Little Falls:** 139 Clove Road, Little Falls, N.J.  From there, enter the Abbott and Costello building and proceed to the 2nd floor to obtain your key.
  + **If your housing assignment is in any other building on campus**: 1 Normal Ave, Montclair, NJ (this is the main address of the University).  You can then use the [**campus map**](https://www.montclair.edu/campus-map/ "Campus map") to get to your housing assignment.
  + **If you plan to live off-campus:**The address of where you will be staying.

**By Train:**

* You will need to catch the NJ Transit train from Newark Liberty International Airport to Secaucus Junction
* Once in Secaucus Junction, you will need to connect with the **Montclair-Boonton Line**. Please note that**this is a commuter train that does not run on weekends.** Use the NJ Transit [**website**](http://www.njtransit.com/sf/sf_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TrainSchedulesTo "NJ Transit website")to search for instructions for catching the train (Newark Liberty International Airport to Montclair State University) or download the [**NJ Transit Mobile App**](https://www.njtransit.com/tickets/app-and-mobile-tickets). You can purchase tickets on the app or at the train station using cash or a credit card.

**From John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)**

If you must arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport, we suggest that you arrange for a friend or family member to pick you up and bring you to campus. We do not recommend taking a taxi from this airport, as the cost will be very high. You can arrange to take the “[**ETS Airport Shuttle**](https://www.etsairportshuttle.com/about "ETS Airport Shuttle")”, a ground shuttle bus from the John F. Kennedy International Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport.  The cost is approximately $34 per person. The shuttle runs every hour from 6:30am-9:30pm. Once you arrive at Newark Liberty International Airport, follow the directions above.

Residential Students

The **[Office of Residence Life](https://www.montclair.edu/residence-life/)** supports you as a student that lives in the residence halls on campus. When living on campus you will have the opportunity to meet people and attend events and activities in your residence hall. Each residence hall has its own lounges, recreation areas, study rooms, and a variety of services.

You will receive an email from Residence Life that will include your room details and information regarding how to access the names and contact details of your fellow roommates. The email will be sent to your Montclair email address, so be sure to check your email.  Each room has one bed, closet, desk, and chair per student. Please note that **bed linens, blankets, pillows, and towels are NOT provided**.  When purchasing these items, remember that the beds are **Twin XL: Extra Long Twin,** not traditional twin size.  If you would like to order these items and have them shipped to Montclair State University, you can look into the following:

* [**Our Campus Market**](http://www.ocm.com/ "Our Campus Market")

When ordering items, please plan ahead and take shipping time into consideration.  Although mail (envelope size) is delivered directly to your residence hall, please note that your packages will **NOT** be delivered directly to your room assignment.  You will have to go to Central Receiving (located on campus in Lot 60—the shuttle can take you there) to retrieve your package(s) and you will need to bring a photo ID. You will receive an email to your Montclair State email address when your packages arrive.  Central Receiving’s hours can be found**[here](https://www.montclair.edu/facilities/our-services/facilities-services/postal-services/student-services/ "Central Receiving hours")** under Student Pickup.  We recommend packing a pillow, blanket, towel, sheet, and any other necessary items until you are able to get your packages.
