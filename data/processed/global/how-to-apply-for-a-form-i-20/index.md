# Applying for the I-20 and F-1 Student Visa

Students who plan to attend Montclair State University on an F-1 visa must provide the necessary financial documentation as soon as possible so we can issue the appropriate immigration forms for them.

Please review our [Estimated I-20 Expenses](https://www.montclair.edu/global/estimated-i-20-expenses/) page for more information about the estimated cost of attendance for your program of study. The amount listed on this page for your program is the amount that you must show in funding in order to to be issued an I-20.

**Important Documents:  
[Application for I-20 and Affidavit of Support](http://www.montclair.edu/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/116/2025/08/2025-26-Montclair-State-University-I-20-Application-Affidavit.pdf)**  
[Affidavit of Free Room and Board](http://www.montclair.edu/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/116/2023/08/Affidavit-of-Free-Room-and-Board-PDF.pdf) – ONLY for students who will be living for free off campus with a family member/friend

Please watch our short video that will walk you through the I-20 application and how to complete it properly: [Completing the I-20 Application.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJuDsG_spAw)

For any questions pertaining to the I-20 application process, please contact [I-20@montclair.edu](mailto:I-20@montclair.edu). We do not accept documents sent via email, please upload all of your documents to your admissions portal.

Upon submission of all required documents, please allow 5-10 business days for your I-20 to be processed. Once available, you will receive an email with further instructions. For more information about your Form I-20: [How to Understand Your Form I-20.](https://www.montclair.edu/global/current-students/f-1-students/understanding-your-i-20)

Sources of Funding Policy

**Your funding will always match the cost of attendance.** For example, if your yearly cost of attendance is $50,000 USD, your funding will also be listed as $50,000 USD, even if your sponsor is promising more than that. The Department of Homeland Security regulations state that a student only has to show proof of funding for the length of a single academic year. If you have multiple sponsors, the total amount that each sponsor is promising must EQUAL your total cost of attendance. Any excess funding will not be listed on the I-20.

Student’s must secure their funding before they can apply for the Form I-20. **Once issued, we will not make changes to the funding section of the I-20.** This includes but is not limited to, adding personal funds, increasing the amount of funding a current sponsor is promising, or adding an additional sponsor when the current sponsor’s funding is sufficient.

We will only issue updated I-20s for one of the following reasons:  
● Errors in the personal information section (incorrect spelling, mistakes in date of birth, etc.)  
● Scholarship or Graduate Assistantships approved after initial I-20 has been issued

**We will not update the funding section because of visa denial.**

If you are receiving a student loan, we will list the amount under “other funding” as “Education Loan.” We do not list student loans as personal funds. If you are planning to use your own funds or familial/sponsor funds in addition to your student loan, you must submit all of this documentation when you initially apply for the I-20. Again, we will not update the funding section of the I-20 once it has been issued.

Incoming students CANNOT be sponsored by a current F-1 student from Montclair. We also do not accept affidavits of free room and board that are completed by other F-1 students.

If you are planning to bring a dependent, you must include their information on your I-20 application, along with their passport information and any necessary funding information. We will not add dependents once the initial I-20 has been issued so please plan for your dependents accordingly.

Deadline for I-20 Application Submission

Students outside the U.S. should submit the I-20 application and financial documentation as soon as possible. The deadline for submission of the application and all supporting documents is:

**Fall semester:** June 15  
**Spring semester:** November 15

**Note:** SEVIS transfer students inside the U.S. may submit this documentation later than the published deadlines.

Required Documents and Where to Submit Them

You must complete and submit the ENTIRE Application for Form I-20 and the Affidavit of Support. We cannot issue any official documents until we have received the entire signed I-20 application and affidavit. The affidavit must be signed by BOTH the sponsor and the student.

Sources of Funding

Any combination of funds is acceptable as long as you demonstrate that you can cover the **[full cost for one year](https://www.montclair.edu/global/estimated-i-20-expenses).** Please note that all costs are estimated for immigration purposes and subject to change. Your accurate cost of attendance will be reflected on your tuition bill. Only submit financial documentation once your source of funding has been finalized. Documents should only be submitted for sponsors that you want to appear on your I-20.

Change of Status Applicants

To change your status, you must choose one of two methods:

* Change of Status by Traveling Outside of and Re-Entering the U.S.

If you are changing your status by traveling outside of the U.S. and applying for the F-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy, you will apply for an initial I-20 by completing the I-20 application process outlined above.

Students who are changing their status from within the U.S. must also complete the I-20 application process. On page 1 of the I-20 application, you will list your current visa status and indicate that you will apply for the status adjustment from within the U.S. In addition to the I-20 application, please complete and submit the [Change of Status Acknowledgement form](http://www.montclair.edu/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/116/2025/09/Change-of-Non-Immigrant-Status-to-F-Status-Acknowledgement.pdf) to your admissions portal. Once your I-20 application and financial documents have been approved, we will issue you an I-20 that will allow you to [apply for the change of status with USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/i-539). Montclair cannot assist with the change of status application process, we highly recommend that you work with an immigration lawyer.

The change of status application is unpredictable and often takes **5 to 10 months** to be approved by USCIS. Please schedule an [appointment with OGE](https://www.montclair.edu/global/appointments/) to discuss your study options while your application is pending. Certain visa types are permitted to begin studying while their change of status application is pending. B1/2 visa holders are NOT permitted to study until their status has been adjusted to F-1.

Students are responsible for their own change of status applications. Once you have submitted your application with USCIS, you must send OGE your receipt number. Once the change has been approved, please notify OGE and send us your official approval notice as soon as you receive it.
