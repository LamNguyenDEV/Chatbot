# Health Insurance

As a condition of their visa, all J-1 students must carry medical and accident insurance coverage that meets the minimum requirements set by the Department of State. Not doing so is a violation of their status and can result in the termination of their SEVIS record. **Montclair State requires that all J-1 students have medical and accident insurance coverage at all times.**

J-1 exchange students can purchase Montclair State’s student coverage or bring their own from their own country, as long as they meet the requirements set by the Department of State.

The minimum requirements set by the Department of State are:

* Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness
* Repatriation of remains in the amount of $25,000
* Expenses associated with the medical evacuation of exchange visitors to his or her home country in the amount of $50,000
* Deductibles not to exceed $500 per accident or illness

All exchange students will be able to waive Montclair State’s insurance if they submit a waiver request by the deadline. **Government subsidized insurance cannot be used for the waiver.** An email will be sent to students before their arrival on campus so they can apply. We cannot guarantee that a waiver will be granted if the request is not submitted by the deadline.

Students who purchase Montclair State’s insurance coverage must [download their insurance card](https://www.aetnastudenthealth.com/en/school/686164/members/get-id-card.html) as a hard copy card will not be mailed to them.
