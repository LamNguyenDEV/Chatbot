# Social Security Numbers

In order to be paid for either on- or off-campus employment, it is necessary to have a Social Security Number (SSN), but an SSN by itself does not authorize you to begin work. If you are in F-1 or J-1 status, participating in unauthorized employment is a violation of your immigration status. For information regarding employment rules and responsibilities, please visit the [Maintaining F-1 Status](http://www.montclair.edu/global/current-students/f-1-students/maintaining-f-1-status/) or [Maintaining J-1 Status](http://www.montclair.edu/global/current-students/j-1-students/maintaining-j-1-status/) page.

## Process for On-campus Employment
