# Invitation Letters

If your family and/or friends would like to visit you in the U.S. to attend your graduation ceremony, sightsee, etc., we recommend that you provide them with an invitation letter. Follow the step-by-step guide below, and gather the proper supporting documents to send to your family and/or friends.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Download the [Invitation Letter (PDF)](http://www.montclair.edu/global/wp-content/uploads/sites/116/2019/11/invitation_letter.pdf).
2. Wherever you see information **[in brackets like this]** you should enter your own information.
3. Once the letter is complete with your information, print on regular printer paper; letterhead is not necessary.
4. Sign the letter in blue ink where you see **[your signature]**.
5. Send the letter to your family and/or friends overseas. Sending the original via postal mail is preferred, but sending a scanned copy is acceptable as well.
6. In addition to this letter, send the following to your family and/or friends:
   * Copies of your I-20 and passport ID page (with your photo).
   * If you are a current student, send copies of your official transcripts. Transcripts can be requested via NEST.
   * If you are graduating, send proof of your graduation. This can be obtained from Red Hawk Central (Cole Hall, 2nd floor)
   * If you are on post-completion OPT/Academic Training, send a copy of your EAD card (front and back) or DS-2019, and an offer letter from your current job.
7. If your family and/or friends would like to know more about applying for the B1/B2 visitor visa, refer them to the [Department of Stateâ€™s website about Visitor Visas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html). The Office of Global Engagement is unable to advise on Visitor Visas.
