# Social and Cultural Programs

The Office of Global Engagement is pleased to offer a variety of social and cultural programs that are focused on enhancing the educational experiences of international students and scholars at Montclair State University.

## Connecting Across Cultures

[Connecting Across Cultures](https://www.montclair.edu/counseling-and-psychological-services/outreach-and-community-programs/connecting-across-cultures/) is an informal, supportive discussion group for international students, students who have studied abroad and any students who are interested in dialoguing and connecting across cultures. It is a place where students can obtain support and make connections at Montclair State University. **The group meets every Thursday from 2-3 p.m. via Zoom.**

## Montclair State World’s Fair

Each spring semester, Montclair State hosts a campus-wide World’s Fair—a celebration of cultures from around the world! The Fair includes international exhibits, entertainment and food, and is held on the quad in the center of campus. Experience the cultural diversity of Montclair State! Listen to music, watch dance performances, learn words in a new language, try cultural crafts, and taste delicious food from around the world. Dozens of university organizations and student groups participate in the festivities. Explore the world, right here at Montclair State!

## International Student Career Week

Are you planning to pursue an internship or career in the U.S.?  Applying for jobs and interviewing in the U.S. can be challenging—not to mention navigating your immigration status! International Student Career Week is held each fall semester and includes workshops on F-1 and J-1 student employment options, immigration options after student status, preparing for job interviews, and job search essentials.

## Social and Cultural Programs/Excursions

The Office of Global Engagement offers ongoing on-campus events and off-campus cultural excursions for international students and scholars.  We also host a culminating International Student Achievement Ceremony each semester, prior to graduation.  These events and excursions promote intercultural understanding and present a broader experience of American culture. Current students and scholars will be notified of programs via e-mail and can also visit our [Engage page](https://montclair.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/international) and/or our [University Calendar](https://www.montclair.edu/calendar/?view=month&calendar=78) to see our upcoming events.  If you have an idea for an event or cultural excursion, let us know; we’re happy to try something new!
