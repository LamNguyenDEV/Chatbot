# H-1B Cap Gap Extension

If your H-1B (Change of Status) petition has been filed by your employer and receipted or approved by USCIS, you are eligible for an automatic Cap Gap Extension I-20 through September 30. If your current Post-Completion OPT or STEM OPT Extension EAD has an end date on or after September 30 you are not eligible for a Cap Gap Extension I-20 as you already have valid work authorization.

To request the Cap Gap Extension I-20, submit the Cap Gap I-20 Request through [My Global Portal.](https://montclair-isss.terradotta.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Security.AngLogin)Â  You will need to upload the following documents:

* Copy of current EAD
* Copy of H-1B I-797 Receipt or Approval Notice

OGE will issue a new Cap Gap I-20. You will receive an email once your I-20 is ready. If you are in the 12-month OPT period, be sure you have updated your employer information via the SEVP portal. If you are on the STEM OPT Extension and have an employer update be sure to submit it through [My Global Portal.](https://montclair-isss.terradotta.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Security.AngLogin)
