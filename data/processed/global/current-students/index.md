# Current International Students

[The Office of Global Engagement](http://montclair.edu/international) is excited to welcome you into the international student community! As an international student, there are a lot of new things for you to experience, such as life in the U.S. and Metro NYC, including new foods, cultures, and ways of life; university campus life, policies, and procedures; and the rules related to your F-1 or J-1 status.

The Office of Global Engagement is here to make your transition into this new environment as easy and comfortable as possible. We offer international students many helpful resources and activities, including International Student Orientation, employment and immigration workshops, weekly conversation groups, including Connecting Across Cultures, cultural and social activities such as our annual Thanksgiving Lunch, and off-campus trips and excursions, such as Broadway shows!

Please refer to the pages below for assistance with navigating Montclair State Universityâ€™s campus, life in Metro NYC, and the federal requirements pertaining to maintaining legal immigration status. For additional questions, feel free to contact the Office of Global Engagement staff at [oge@montclair.edu](mailto:oge@montclair.edu).
