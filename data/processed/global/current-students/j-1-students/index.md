# J-1 Students

The [J-1 Exchange Visitor Program](https://j1visa.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/J1-VIsa-fact-sheet-2018.pdf) promotes mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries through educational and cultural exchanges. Participants are leaders eager to hone their skills, strengthen their English language abilities, connect with Americans, and learn more about the United States. The hope is that J-1 students return home eager to stay connected, to expand their networks, and to explore future exchange opportunities as citizen ambassadors.

Unless sponsored by the Fulbright Program or another government-funded program, all degree-seeking students coming to Montclair State University must enroll in an F-1 visa to pursue their degree at the University.

To be eligible for this visa category you must be either:

* Participating in a study abroad program at Montclair State through one of our international partner schools; or
* Financed directly or indirectly by the U.S. government, the government of your home country, or an international organization of which the United States is a member by treaty or statute; or
* Receiving financial support to study in the U.S. through resources other than personal or family funds;

If you have any questions about the J-1 visa category please contact the Office of Global Engagement at [oge@montclair.edu](mailto:oge@montclair.edu).
