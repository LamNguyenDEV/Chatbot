# Employment

There are three options available for employment for J-1 students. Each type of employment requires authorization. Failure to get proper authorization for each type of employment constitutes a failure to maintain status.

* [On-campus employment](http://www.montclair.edu/global/on-campus-employment/)
* [Academic training](http://www.montclair.edu/global/academic-training/)
* Severe economic hardship

If you are experiencing **severe economic hardship**, please [make an appointment](https://www.montclair.edu/global/appointments/) with the Office of Global Engagement for specific information regarding the application process.
