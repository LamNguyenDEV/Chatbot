# J-1 Program Extension

Students who believe they will not complete their program by the program end date listed on their Form DS-2019 must request an extension before the end date. If a request is not made before the program end date the student will be out of status.

Note that extending the Form DS-2019 does NOT automatically extend the validity of the J-1 visa on the student’s passport. If the visa is expired, the student will have to apply for a new visa before returning to the United States. See more information about [reviewing a J-1 visa](http://www.montclair.edu/global/current-students/j-1-students/travel-on-j1-status/).

The OGE can only process program extensions for the DS-2019s we issued; if the student has a different sponsor (for example, Fulbright, NSF, IREX, etc.), he/she needs to contact the sponsor directly to request the extension.

The processing time for a program extension is 7 business days. Plan accordingly!

To apply for a program extension students must submit their request through [MyGlobal Portal](https://montclair-isss.terradotta.com/). Through the online application students will have to:

1. Upload proof of finances showing enough funding to cover all their expenses (and their dependents) for the additional time needed. The DS-2019 can be extended up to a year at a time. Each subsequent extension will require more detailed documentation.
2. Provide their academic advisor’s information. The academic advisor will have to provide an explanation of a compelling academic or medical reason for the extension and the new expected completion date. Note that our office cannot extend your DS-2019 to facilitate academic training.

In addition, students must show proof of health insurance that [meets the requirements](https://www.montclair.edu/global/health-insurance/) set by the Department of State requirements for themselves and their dependents.
