# Change of Education Level

As an F-1 student, you are issued an I-20 and admitted to the United States for a specific educational program. If you have received admission to a new program of study at Montclair State University (for instance, if you are completing a bachelor’s and beginning a master’s or just starting a new degree program at the same level, like a second master’s degree), you must obtain a new Form I-20 for your new program **before your F-1 status for your current program of study ends**.

Before changing your program of study, meet with faculty members from the academic department that houses the program in which you are interested. You should gain a full understanding of the degree requirements (including what credits, if any, will transfer from your current program) and admissions process before starting a new program. Once you are certain you want to start a new degree program (or change programs), you should submit your application to admissions. If you are simply changing majors, you may not need to complete the process described below, but you will still need a new I-20.

Students must receive an updated Form I-20 prior to the beginning of every new program and level of study.

Your Change of Level I-20 must be issued before the end of your grace period (60 days after the end of your current degree or OPT/STEM OPT period).  The new program must start within 5 months of your current end date. If your new program starts more than 5 months in the future, you will have to leave the U.S. and reenter with an initial I-20. 

#### **How to apply:**

1. Apply for admission to your new program.
2. If you are accepted apply for Change of Level I-20 through [MyGlobal Portal](https://montclair-isss.terradotta.com/)
3. Once your new I-20 is issued, the Office of Global Engagement will contact you.

**Please Note:**

If you are transferring to another U.S. school to start a new program of study, you will instead follow the steps outlined on the [Transferring Schools](http://www.montclair.edu/global/current-students/f-1-students/transferring-schools/) page.
