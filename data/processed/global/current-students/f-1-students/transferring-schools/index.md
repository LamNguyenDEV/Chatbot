# Transferring Schools

## For international students with F-1 visa status only. U.S. students, please contact Red Hawk Central for assistance with a leave of absence.

If you will be moving from Montclair State University to another SEVIS-approved school in the U.S. for any reason, you must request that the Office of Global Engagement transfer your SEVIS record so that your new school can in turn issue you an I-20 for attendance there.

**If you are not an international student on F-1 status and you are looking to transfer, please contact Red Hawk Central.**

## Am I Eligible to Transfer?

In order to be eligible to have your F-1 record transferred in SEVIS:

1. You must be in valid F-1 status.
2. You must have a letter of admission to another SEVIS-approved school in the U.S.
3. Your program of study at your new school must begin **within five months** of your last day of class at Montclair State **or** at the start of the next available semester/term at your new school, whichever comes sooner.

## **What to Do**

* Submit the Transfer-Out Request in [MyGlobal Portal](https://montclair-isss.terradotta.com/)
* Upload your new schoolâ€™s transfer-in form, if applicable
* Upload a copy of your letter of admission letter to the new school

On the release date, your F-1 record (and the records of any F-2 dependents you have) will be electronically transferred to your new school in SEVIS. Your new school will instruct you regarding applying for a new I-20.

## **Setting the Release Date of Your F-1 Record**

* The SEVIS release date is the date your F-1 record and the records of any F-2 dependents are electronically transferred to your new school in SEVIS.
* As of this date, you are no longer considered an F-1 student at Montclair State University, even if you continue to take classes at Montclair State.
* The release date must be between the end of one semester at Montclair State University and the beginning of a new semester at your new school, but the space between these must be less than five months. You must begin study at your new school *at the start of the next required term;* you cannot skip a semester without studying.
* If you completed your program of study at Montclair State, the release date can be no later than 60 days after the program end date on your I-20 or the end date on your post-completion OPT EAD.
* When your F-1 record is transferred in SEVIS, your off-campus employment authorization (OPT, Severe Economic Hardship Employment, etc.) automatically ends on the transfer release date, so please coordinate accordingly with your new school.
