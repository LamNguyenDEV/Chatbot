# F-1 Student Employment

F-1 students have several employment options available to them, as follows:

* [On-Campus Employment](http://www.montclair.edu/global/current-students/f-1-students/f-1-student-employment/on-campus-employment/)
* Off-Campus Employment
  + [Curricular Practical Training (CPT)](http://www.montclair.edu/global/current-students/f-1-students/f-1-student-employment/curricular-practical-training-cpt/)
  + [Optional Practical Training (OPT)](http://www.montclair.edu/global/current-students/f-1-students/f-1-student-employment/optional-practical-training-opt/)
  + [Optional Practical Training 24-Month STEM Extension](http://www.montclair.edu/global/current-students/f-1-students/f-1-student-employment/stem-optional-practical-training-opt/)

If you are experiencing **severe economic hardship**, please make an appointment with the Office of Global Engagement for specific information regarding the application process.

In order to work in an off-campus job, you must get permission from the Office of Global Engagement and from the Department of Homeland Security. Apart from a few limited exceptions (such as unremunerated work for a charitable organization), all off-campus work, both paid and unpaid, requires this authorization. Failure to obtain proper authorization for off-campus work constitutes a violation of F-1 status.
