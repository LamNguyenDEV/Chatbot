# On-Campus Employment

* F-1 students may work on campus 20 hours per week or less during “required terms” (fall and spring semesters) and full-time on campus during vacation periods (summer, spring break and winter break). You will violate your F-1 status if you work more than 20 hours a week during fall and spring semesters.
* Jobs can be found on [Handshake](https://www.montclair.edu/career-services/handshake/).
* Employment with organizations that operate within the university, such as the various [Montclair State Dining locations](https://www.dineoncampus.com/montclair/where-to-eat), are considered “on campus.”
* If you have multiple on-campus jobs, you must be sure that your total work hours do not exceed 20 hours per week during the fall and spring semesters.
* You may not engage in employment during the 60-day grace period following your program end date.
* You must continue to study full-time and make satisfactory progress toward the completion of your degree while working on campus. If an on-campus job is hindering your studies, that employment may be ended.
* A Social Security Number is required in order to begin employment. If you need a social security number, submit a Social Security Letter request through [MyGlobal Portal](https://montclair-isss.terradotta.com).
