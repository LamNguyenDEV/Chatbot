# F-1 Students

Montclair State University warmly welcomes our international students in F-1 status!

As an F-1 student, there are a number of rules and procedures that you are required to follow in order to maintain legal immigration status. Please refer to the pages below for assistance with these federal requirements, which pertain to study, employment, travel and more. For any additional questions, please contact the Office of Global Engagement at [oge@montclair.edu](mailto:oge@montclair.edu).
