# About Montclair

Welcome to Montclair State University and New Jersey, where you will always find something fun and exciting to do when you are not studying!  In addition to all the activities on campus, it is easy to explore the city of Montclair, New York City, the famous beaches of the Jersey Shore, and the great outdoors.  With two bus stops and two train stations on campus, getting out and about is easy. Here are just a few entertaining options.

Downtown Montclair

There’s plenty to do in our own backyard!  The 10 blocks along Bloomfield Avenue, known as Montclair Center, have it all. Spend a Saturday strolling down Church Street and South Park Street, where you can find some of the best shopping in the area. Montclair’s restaurant scene is one of the best in New Jersey, with local favorites like the fun, alfresco experience at Cuban Pete’s.

For entertainment, check out the historic Wellmont Theater and Clairidge Cinema. The Wellmont has a full calendar of live performances, from rock concerts to comedy shows, and the Clairidge shows blockbusters in addition to its impressive selection of international and indie films. With over 26,000 attendees, the annual Montclair Film Festival has become one of the top regional festivals in the United States, with past celebrity guests including Stephen Colbert, Julie Taymor, Laura Linney, Richard Gere, Bill Nye and many more.

Transportation

Montclair State University is part of the larger New Jersey transit system with two bus stops and two train stations located on campus. The Montclair-Boonton train and several bus lines from campus arrive in New York City in about an hour, and they also provide direct access to the Upper Montclair Business District, Watchung Plaza and Bloomfield Avenue. Even better – full-time undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to receive a rail, bus, or light rail monthly pass at a 25% discount. In addition to providing transportation around the vast campus, Campus Shuttles also make Saturday trips to Montclair Center and the Clifton Commons theater and shopping center, free of charge!

The Jersey Shore

Immortalized in songs, movies and television shows, the famous Jersey Shore encompasses 130 miles of oceanfront from Sandy Hook to the southernmost tip of Cape May Point, and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.  Enjoy rides, treats and games along the Ocean City or Wildwood boardwalks. See the sharks, seals and other aquatic life up close at Point Pleasant’s world-class Jenkinson’s Aquarium.  In Cape May, you can tour romantic streets lined with Victorian mansions, and climb to the top of the Cape May Lighthouse to take in the views.  With 75 different beach towns and activities including concerts, festivals, arcades, casinos, mini golf, surfing, fishing, swimming, scuba diving, snorkeling and sunbathing, there’s truly something for everyone!

New York City

It’s famed as the city that never sleeps.  With New York City less than an hour away and easy transportation by bus or train, there is always something to do.  Catch a Broadway show, concert, sports game or visit any of the 100 museums the city has to offer.  Want some company?  Join one of the regular group trips organized by the Center for Student Involvement or Campus Recreation – you can make new friends, transportation is included, and you’ll get a discount, too!

Nature

When you need a break from studying, retreat to the natural paradise of the mountains!  No matter the season, the bordering Pocono Mountains offer breathtaking views and adventurous excursions. An invigorating rafting trip down the Delaware River is the most exciting way to cool down on a hot, summer day. Winter is even more action-packed, with activities that include skiing, snowboarding, dog sledding, snowshoeing, snow tubing and even ice climbing. Hiking and camping are popular year-round.
