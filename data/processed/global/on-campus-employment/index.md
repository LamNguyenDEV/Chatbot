# On-Campus Employment

**J-1 students must be authorized in SEVIS for on-campus employment before the employment begins.** Authorization can be granted for up to 12 months at a time or up to the end of your DS-2019, whichever comes first. 

J-1 students who have a valid Montclair State DS-2019 and are maintaining their J-1 status can work part-time on campus while attending classes. Please note:

* Students may work part-time (20 hours or less per week) on campus during the fall and spring semesters.
* Students may work full-time (21 hours or more) on campus during vacation periods (summer, winter break, and spring break).
* Students can only work within their program start and end date as listed on their DS-2019.
* If multiple jobs are held on campus, students must make sure that the total number of hours does not exceed 20 hours per week during the fall and spring semesters.
* Full-time class enrollment is **required** while working on campus and students must be making satisfactory progress toward their degree.
* Employment with companies that operate within the university (such as Panera Bread), are counted as “on-campus.”

**How to apply**

In order to apply for an on-campus position, you must look for opportunities and apply through [Handshake](https://www.montclair.edu/career-services/handshake/). More information about how to upload a resume, participate in mock interviews, or search for open positions can be found [online](https://www.montclair.edu/career-services/handshake/).

Once hired, you must obtain employment authorization from the Office of Global Engagement **before they start employment**. You must log in to their [MyGlobal Portal](https://montclair-isss.terradotta.com/) and, under *the My Requests* tab, select “J Student Employment”. You will have to upload an Employment Confirmation Letter that your on-campus employment supervisor needs to provide.

A Social Security Card is required in order to begin employment. It is not available without proof of legal work authorization and proof of an employer. If you are offered an on-campus job but do not have a Social Security Card, see the [Social Security Numbers](http://www.montclair.edu/global/life-in-the-united-states/social-security-numbers/) section for instructions regarding how to obtain a card.
