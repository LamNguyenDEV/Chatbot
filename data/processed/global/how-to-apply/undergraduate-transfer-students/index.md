# International Undergraduate Transfer Students

The Office of Global Engagement at Montclair State University is available to assist international students through every stage of the journey from new applicant through to graduation.

Montclair State University considers a transfer student one who has attempted 16 or more credits from an accredited college or university after graduating high school or earning a high school diploma equivalent. Review our [Transfer FAQs](https://www.montclair.edu/admissions/transfer-faqs/) for answers to some of the most commonly asked Transfer Admissions questions.

**Application Deadlines:**

* Fall/August semester: June 1 \*
* Spring/January semester: November 1 \*

\* Suggested deadlines for students outside the U.S. International students currently in the U.S. may have additional flexibility.

Step 1

Online Application

Submit your application by clicking on the button below:

Step 2

Application Fee

Pay the non-refundable $65.00 Application Fee. After you complete the application you will see instructions for paying the fee.

\*If you are applying to a program with an audition fee (Dance, Music, Music Therapy, Musical Theater or Theater), you will also see and be able to pay your audition fee through your status page.

Step 3

Academic Evaluation

An academic evaluation and English translation of all coursework completed in another country **are required at the time of application**. Transfer students must submit an evaluation of their official high school transcript and a course-by-course evaluation of college-level work.

Submission/evaluation of the high school transcript is waived for applicants who have completed or will have completed an associate’s degree, or students who have completed 30 or more college-level credits at a four-year institution. Although Montclair State University no longer requires SAT or ACT scores, students with fewer than 30 completed college credits may submit their scores if they would like them considered in the application process.

Students who have not earned an Associates degree or who have fewer than 30 credits must submit their secondary/high school academic transcripts/credentials/exam scores. For more information about these credentials, please see [here](https://www.montclair.edu/global/required-academic-documentation-for-undergraduate-applicants/).

The evaluation must come from an organization affiliated with the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES). A listing of NACES member organizations is available at [NACES](https://www.naces.org/members).
