# Reduced Course Load

According to the Code of Federal Regulations, all students must study full-time every required term (fall and spring semesters) and progress toward the completion of their academic programs [8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(I)]. Students may be approved for a Reduced Course Load (RCL) only for documented medical reasons or for a very limited number of academic reasons. Additionally, students are allowed to take fewer than a full-time course load if it is their final semester and they need fewer credits to complete their program.

RCL for Final Semester

OGE may approve a Reduced Course Load (RCL) for your final term, semester, or session if you need fewer courses to complete your degree requirements. Please note that you must be registered for the semester before your RCL request can be reviewed. Additionally, your academic advisor or Graduate Program Coordinator (GPC) must confirm that this is your final term before OGE can authorize the RCL (see instructions below).

Keep in mind that during your final semester, you are not permitted to enroll exclusively in online courses—you must be registered for at least one in-person or hybrid class.

If you have completed all academic requirements for your program and are enrolled only for administrative reasons (e.g., thesis submission or graduation processing), you are considered to have completed your course of study. In this case, you must take appropriate action to maintain your immigration status, such as applying for OPT, applying for a change of status or preparing to depart the U.S.

RCL for a Medical Reason

Students may apply for a reduced course load (or, if necessary, no course load) due to a temporary illness or medical condition. Medical RCLs can be approved for no more than an aggregate of 12 months per education level. In order to authorize a reduced course load based upon a medical condition, the student must provide medical documentation from a U.S.-based licensed medical doctor, a licensed doctor of osteopathy, a licensed psychologist, or a licensed clinical psychologist to the DSO to substantiate the illness or medical condition. If the medical condition persists past one semester, the student must provide updated medical documentation so that the DSO can reauthorize the drop below full course of study for the new semester.

RCL for Academic Reasons

OGE may authorize an RCL for specific academic reasons. If you are experiencing academic difficulties and are considering dropping below a full-time course load, please schedule an [appointment](https://www.montclair.edu/global/appointments/) with your OGE advisor **before** making any changes to your enrollment. Note that academic RCLs can only be approved for one semester per program level. If you have already received an academic RCL in the past, you would not be eligible for a second authorization for academic difficulties while in the same program.
