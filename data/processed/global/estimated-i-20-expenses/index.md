# Estimated I-20 Expenses

Montclair State University remains committed to making education affordable for all international students, regardless of their country of origin. As a public institution, we cannot administer need-based financial aid to international students. Unless awarded a merit-based scholarship or assistantship, international students must plan to pay the entire cost of attending Montclair State University. International students on F-1 status will be charged out-of-state tuition. These estimates are based on one academic year (18 credits for graduate students, 24-36 credits for undergraduate students).

All tuition, fees, and room and board charges are subject to change upon approval of the University’s Board of Trustees. Room and board cost reflects an average cost, considering all housing options and meal plans.

\*Please note that the “Tuition and Fees” amount that is listed on the [MBA website](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/student-accounts/tuition-fees/mba-program/) is for students taking 6 credits per semester.  F-1 students are required to take a full-time course load each fall and spring semester, so the estimated amounts in the above table reflect the cost of studying full-time (9 credits/term for MBA students).
