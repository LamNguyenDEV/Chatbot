# Research

## Research Clusters

The School’s six research clusters create a foundation for interdisciplinary research, bringing together expertise in computing, health, and engineering. These clusters closely align with Montclair State University’s broader initiatives in Engineering, Computing, and Applied Data Science, especially in areas like AI, cybersecurity, data engineering, and health. The research clusters at SoC offer students access to a wealth of expertise and state-of-the-art resources, fostering a vibrant, interdisciplinary environment.

The SoC research clusters present a framework of innovation partnerships focused on interdisciplinary research and collaboration in health, engineering, and computing. This framework strongly aligns with Montclair State University’s initiatives in Engineering, Computing, and Applied Data Science, particularly in the areas of AI, cybersecurity, data engineering, and interdisciplinary applications in health and resilient systems. Montclair’s approach mirrors the interdisciplinary, innovation-driven model in the SoC research framework presented below, integrating computing, engineering, and societal impact.

AI Engineered Systems &lpar;AIES&rpar;

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping the landscape of modern computing, offering new opportunities for intelligent automation, decision-making, and system adaptability. The AIES research cluster at Montclair State University focuses on harnessing AI to develop innovative, high-performance systems that are capable of autonomously improving and responding to dynamic challenges. By integrating AI into the core architecture of computing systems, we aim to create self-optimizing, data-driven frameworks that can learn, adapt, and scale as needed to address complex, real-world problems.

Software Engineering Reliability and Privacy &lpar;SWRP&rpar;

As software systems become more complex, ubiquitous, and interconnected across various domains—including finance, healthcare, transportation, and critical infrastructure—the need for reliability and privacy has never been more urgent. The Software Engineering, Reliability, and Privacy (SWRP) Cluster is dedicated to advancing research in secure and resilient software engineering practices. This cluster brings together interdisciplinary expertise to address fundamental challenges in building dependable, privacy-conscious, and secure software systems capable of withstanding evolving cybersecurity threats and operational disruptions.

Cyber-physical Resilient Systems &lpar;CPRS&rpar;

The CPRS cluster focuses on building secure and resilient systems for the next generation of interconnected technologies. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine physical components (like sensors, actuators, and machinery) with digital elements (such as software, networks, and AI) to create interconnected systems that operate in critical sectors like energy, healthcare, transportation, and defense. However, the interconnected nature of CPS introduces vulnerabilities that must be addressed through resilient design, cybersecurity, and real-time response mechanisms. This cluster’s research aims to solve problems specific to IoT, smart infrastructure, autonomous systems, and other critical infrastructures, ensuring that these systems can continue to function even under extreme conditions.
