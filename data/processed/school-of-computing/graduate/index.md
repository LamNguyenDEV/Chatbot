* algorithms
* artificial intelligence
* automata theory
* chaos theory
* complexity theory
* databases
* data mining
* data warehousing
* expert systems
* graphics
* image processing
* machine organization
* architecture and hardware
* design/management information systems
* neural networks
* operating systems
* object-oriented programming
* parallel processing
* program verification
* robotics
* scientific computing
* security
* software engineering
* telecommunications

The School has the advantage of having professional computer scientists as both faculty and visiting specialists. Visiting specialists are drawn from the aerospace, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. This mix of faculty affords students an a diverse practical and theoretical computer science and information technology education.
