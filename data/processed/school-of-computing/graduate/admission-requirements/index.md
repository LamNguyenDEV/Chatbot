# Admission Requirements

## Entrance Requirements for Matriculation

Students are welcomed directly into the Master of Science programs listed below if they have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or Information Technology. Students who wish to make a career change and have limited or no background in Computer Science and/or Information Technology will be accepted under the condition of bridging the gap through a program of study that will require anywhere from one to four courses in Computer Science Fundamentals. These additional courses do not count towards degree credit.

Applications are reviewed through a rolling process throughout each semester.

Please visit the page for your program of interest for specific admissions requirements:

* [Computer Science (MS)](/graduate/programs-of-study/computer-science-ms/)
* [Computer Science (Combined BS/MS)](/graduate/programs-of-study/computer-science-combined-bsms/)
* [Computing Technology (Certificate)](/graduate/programs-of-study/computing-technology-certificate/)
* [Computational Linguistics (MS)](/graduate/programs-of-study/computational-linguistics-ms/)
* [Cybersecurity (MS)](/graduate/programs-of-study/cybersecurity-ms/)
* [Data Science (MS)](/graduate/programs-of-study/data-science-ms/)
* [Information Technology (MS)](/graduate/programs-of-study/information-technology-ms/)
* [Information Technology, Applied Information Technology Concentration (Online PSM Program)](/online/graduate-degrees/information-technology-ms-psm/)

## Prerequisite Program

The computer science faculty has developed a series of six courses that will enable applicants desiring to make a career change or to complement their current career to obtain the necessary background in mathematics and computer science in order to pursue a graduate degree in computer science. Students who have deficiencies in some of the six areas and satisfy others may only be required to take some of the courses to make up their specific deficiencies. Two sequences of three courses each have been developed that will enable students to obtain the necessary foundations in computer science and mathematics. The [Computational Linguistics (MS)](/graduate/programs-of-study/computational-linguistics-ms/) has its own prerequisites, view the program page to view those.

### Computer Science Courses

* [CSIT 501: Java Programming](http://catalog.montclair.edu/search/?search=csit+501) – 4 credits, Fall
* [CSIT 502: Computer Systems Principles](http://catalog.montclair.edu/search/?search=csit+502) – 4 credits, Spring
* [CSIT 503: Data Structures](http://catalog.montclair.edu/search/?search=csit+503) – 4 credits, Spring

### Mathematics Courses

* [CSIT 504: Discrete Math in Computing](http://catalog.montclair.edu/search/?search=csit+504) – 4 credits, Fall

### Addressing Deficiencies

Deficiencies in computer science can be rectified by taking CSIT: 501, 502, and 503. It should be noted that the computer science courses are accelerated computer science courses designed for the student to master he necessary concepts for the graduate program rather than courses just to develop routine programming skills. Deficiencies in mathematics can be rectified by taking CSIT 504, which are accelerated Mathematics courses. When required, these courses will be “prerequisite courses” on the graduate work program. The sequence requires one academic year to complete (i.e., Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters) but can be taken over a two year period. Applicants satisfying admission requirements but needing to make up some or all of the work in the fundamentals of Mathematics and/or Computer Science (CSIT: 501, 502, 503 and 504) are granted deferred matriculation. Upon completion of the necessary courses with a minimum grade point average of 3.0, students will be granted full matriculation.
