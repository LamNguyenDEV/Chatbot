# Undergraduate Students

The School of Computing at Montclair State University educates students for positions in industry and graduate school. Students may participate in [Cooperative Education](/csam/current-students/career-services/cooperative-education-and-internships/) where the students receive real-world experience, academic credit and salaries. A student organized [computing club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1568331700057872/) provides another opportunity for student interaction.

The Computer Science curriculum prepares students to design and implement software, to consider new ways to use computers, to assist in improving solutions to computer problems, and generally helps students to adapt to new ideas. The BS in CS and BS in IT are accredited by the Computer Accreditation Commission of [ABET](https://www.abet.org). This program was recently changed to be the singular BS in CS degree program, and a name change of the accredited degree is pending. A chapter of [Upsilon Pi Epsilon](https://upe.acm.org/), the national honor society in computer science, is available for outstanding students.

The BS in Information Technology degree prepares students to use computing technology to create and process information to meet enterprise’s goals. Although both Computer Science and Information Technology students learn about theory, innovation and computing applications, Computer Science tends to work more with theory and innovation while Information Technology tends to work more with computing applications.

The Applied Mathematics and Statistics BS comprises common core courses, foundational Python programming courses and an application-area sequence. These courses provide students with a broad introduction to important theoretical, computational, and statistical techniques. The application-area sequence provides a base of knowledge in a particular field of study. Options include: biology, chemistry, computer science, earth and environmental science, economics or physics.

Beyond the common courses, the BS in Applied Mathematics and Statistics comprises three tracks, of which students choose one. Regardless of track, each student must also satisfy the experiential learning component, choosing either an internship or capstone project.
