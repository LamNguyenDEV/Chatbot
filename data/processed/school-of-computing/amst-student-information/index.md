# Applied Mathematics and Statistics Student Information

Applied Mathematics and Statistics are interdisciplinary fields of study and research, linking mathematics with many other fields including:

* biology
* chemistry
* computer science
* engineering
* environmental science
* ecology
* economics
* finance
* physics
* sustainability science

A career in applied mathematics and statistics is more than just crunching numbers. Instead, it involves solving real-world problems and making an impact in the world. View our [undergraduate and graduate degrees](#degrees).

## Why study Applied Mathematics and Statistics?

Companies are hiring more and more applied mathematicians and statisticians every year. The [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/mathematicians-and-statisticians.htm#:~:text=The%20median%20annual%20wage%20for,was%20%2492%2C270%20in%20May%202020.&text=Overall%20employment%20of%20mathematicians%20and,the%20average%20for%20all%20occupations.) estimates a 33% increase over ten years in high-paying jobs for these degree holders. In short, applied mathematics and statistics degrees position you to contribute to society in various fields with high earning potential.

## Where are the jobs?

Numerous organizations hire applied mathematicians and statisticians. Here are just a few examples

* Academic institutions and research institutes
* Aerospace and transportation manufacturers or service providers
* Analytics and forecasting organizations
* Chemical or pharmaceutical manufacturers
* Communications services providers
* Computer information and software firms
* Consumer products companies
* Energy systems firms
* Electronics and computer manufacturers
* Engineering research organizations
* Financial service and investment management firms
* Government labs, research offices and research agencies
* Insurance companies
* Medical device companies
* Producers of petroleum and petroleum-based products

## Problems to Solve

Applied Mathematicians and Statisticians solve real-world problems. Using classical methods of applied mathematics, modeling, statistics, modern methods of data-driven analysis, machine learning, and other computational techniques. A few potential problems that you could work on include:

* How does one predict the spread of infectious disease, and how can vaccines or quarantines contain the spread of diseases?
* How does one design a detailed experimental plan for the clinical trial of a new drug?
* How does one quantify the risk/reward of financial assets, bonds, futures, options, etc?
* How does one utilize mathematical and computational models to predict the path of an oil spill?
* How does one estimate the affect of climate related events on society and ecosystems?
* How does one optimize the use of buses and trains for a city’s transit system?

## Undergraduate Degree

The [Applied Mathematics and Statistics BS](https://www.montclair.edu/school-of-computing/applied-mathematics-and-statistics/bs-in-applied-mathematics-and-statistics-overview/) comprises common core courses, foundational Python programming courses and an application-area sequence. These courses provide students with a broad introduction to important theoretical, computational, and statistical techniques. The application-area sequence provides a base of knowledge in a particular field of study. Options include: biology, chemistry, computer science, earth and environmental science, economics or physics.

Beyond the common courses, the BS in Applied Mathematics and Statistics comprises three tracks, of which students choose one:

* [Applied Math and Stats BS with The Applied Mathematics track](http://catalog.montclair.edu/programs/applied-math-and-statistics-bs/#fouryearplantext), composed of additional courses in theoretical and computational applied mathematics
* [Applied Math and Stats BS with The Statistics track](http://catalog.montclair.edu/programs/applied-math-and-statistics-bs/#fouryearplantext), composed of additional courses in statistical analysis
* [Applied Math and Stats BS with The Mathematics of Finance track](http://catalog.montclair.edu/programs/applied-math-and-statistics-bs/#fouryearplantext), comprises additional courses in theoretical and computational financial mathematics

Regardless of track, each student must also satisfy the experiential learning component, choosing either an internship or capstone project. You can also combine your BS in Applied Mathematics and Statistics with an MBA utilizing the [4+1 Program](/combined-programs/programs-of-study/business-administration-combined-bachelors-mba/).

## Graduate Degrees

### MS in Applied Mathematics

The Applied Mathematics MS program provides both foundational and in-depth applied mathematics knowledge and skills to support specific goals. Alumni of this program are prepared for a variety of career goals professionally and academically. Employment opportunities include industries where the analytic capacities of applied mathematicians are highly sought after. Additionally, the program extends the competency development of secondary school teachers in these exciting areas of mathematics.

The Applied Mathematics program was formulated with the intent to train students for a post-MS career in industry. Although, there’s flexibility for students interested in pursuing doctoral studies or to teach at the secondary level. Beyond courses, participation in one of three possible culminating experiences is required: an internship, capstone project or thesis.

### MS in Statistics

The MS in Statistics has been developed for students interested in becoming practitioners of statistics, trained in statistical methodologies. The program emphasizes the foundations and concepts of statistics as well as the new and developing areas of statistics. Though the applications of statistical sciences are emphasized, the theoretical foundations are presented as well. Students are prepared for professional work designing and analyzing statistical experiments and models. They are versed in data analytic techniques and associated computational methods and in statistical computing.

The accessibility of computers and powerful data analysis software has led to widespread utilization of statistics in many industries. Students and faculty have access to state-of-the-art interactive computing environments for data analysis and data graphics.
