Applied mathematics is focused on developing mathematical methods and applying them to science, engineering, industry, and society. Mathematical topics include partial and ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, numerical analysis, computation, machine learning, operations research, discrete mathematics, optimization, control and probability. Applied mathematics uses mathematical modeling techniques to solve real-world problems.

Statistics is the science concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. It incorporates Data Analysis but goes beyond to understand uncertainty and variability in the data.

Statistics finds applicability in virtually every field with topics including:

* descriptive statistics
* regression methods
* categorical data analysis
* sampling methods
* computational statistics
* data analysis
* experimental design
* probability models
* multivariate statistics
* non-parametric statistics
* statistical theory
* biostatistics
* data mining

Statistics uses statistical techniques and data analysis to solve real-world problems.
