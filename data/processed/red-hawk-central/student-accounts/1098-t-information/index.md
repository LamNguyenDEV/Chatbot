# 1098-T Information

Montclair State University is required to furnish a 1098-T to all students who made a payment toward a[qualified tuition and related expenses](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/qualified-ed-expenses) during the current tax year. The 1098-T form helps students and parents determine eligibility for an American Opportunity Tax Credit or Lifetime Learning Credit.

The 1098-T is provided each year on or before January 31. The data reported on the 1098-T is based on the tax year (January – December), not the academic year. Prior to the tax year 2018, Montclair State University 1098-Ts included a figure in Box 2 that represented the amounts *billed* during the calendar year for qualified tuition and related expenses (QTRE). Due to a change to institutional reporting requirements under federal law, beginning with tax year 2018, educational institutions are required to report in Box 1 the amount of *payments received* for QTRE from all sources (including scholarships, loans, and other third-party payments) during the calendar year rather than amounts billed. Box 2 reporting of amounts billed is no longer applicable.

What Are Students Supposed To Do With the Form When They Receive Their 1098-T?

Amounts paid are reported on your 1098-T form based on the date the **payment** is posted to your account, regardless of the date or term the **charge** is posted.

**I am a student who received emergency financial aid funding for unexpected expenses, unmet financial needs, and/or expenses related to the disruption of campus operations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Is this grant included in my gross income?**

Emergency financial aid grants under this emergency act for unexpected expenses, unmet financial needs, or expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic are qualified disaster relief payments under [section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/139) The most recent FAQs indicate that higher education institutions must report total Qualified Tuition and Related Expenses (QTRE), paid with HEERF grant funds, in Box 1 of Form 1098-T. Higher education institutions do not need to separately identify the portion of QTRE paid with HEERF grants anywhere else on Form 1098-T, and they do not need to report the grants themselves in Box 5 of Form 1098-T. This is the case regardless of whether the higher education institution paid the emergency financial aid grants to a student, who then used grant money to pay for QTRE, or applied grant money directly to a QTRE on a student’s account.

**I received an emergency financial aid grant and used some of it to pay for course materials now required for online learning because my college or university campus is closed. Can I claim a tuition and fees deduction for the cost as a qualifying education expense for claiming the American Opportunity Credit or the Lifetime Learning Credit?**

No. Because the emergency financial aid grant is not included in your gross income, you cannot claim any deduction or credit for expenses paid with the grant, including the tuition and fees deduction, the American Opportunity Credit, or the Lifetime Learning Credit. See [section 139(h) of the Internal Revenue Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/139).

Emergency financial aid grants are for unexpected expenses, unmet financial needs, or expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are qualified as disaster relief payments under [section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/139). This grant is not included in Box 5.

Why Did I Not Receive a 1098T?
:   * Eligible educational institutions are required by the IRS to prepare Form 1098-T for *most* students who paid for “qualified educational expenses” in the preceding year. Consistent with IRS Regulations, **Montclair State University is not required to provide Form 1098-T to a student in the following instances:**
    * Students whose qualified tuition and related expenses posting in the reporting year were entirely waived or paid entirely with scholarships posted in the reporting year (noting that payments for the Spring semester frequently post in the *previous* reporting year and are thus reflected in the prior year’s Form 1098-T)
    * Courses for which no academic credit is offered or earned, even if the student is otherwise enrolled in a degree program
    * **If you fall under one of these exceptions, you will not receive a Form 1098-T from the University.**
