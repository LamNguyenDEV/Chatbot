## Payment Plan Information

All students are responsible for ensuring their contracts are correct and payments are up to date. Keep in mind that as your bill changes, your TouchNet payment plan will be automatically adjusted to accommodate your balance.

* Students can enroll for one (1) semester at a time and may have one (1) active plan per semester.
* This plan is interest-free and available for a modest fee.
* **This is NOT a loan.** Students MUST satisfy their previous balance prior to enrollment.
* **If your previous balance exceeds $50.00, enrollment is prohibited**. Past due balances are not included in the plan. It is recommended that students resolve any past due balance prior to enrollment as a previous balance may prevent your payment plan from recalculating correctly.
* There is a $30.00 enrollment fee due upon enrollment.
* Each payment plan allows for a five (5) day grace period. Payment due dates are stated on your finance agreement. A $25.00 late fee will be assessed for all payments made after the grace period. If you do not set up an automatic withdrawal, the student is responsible to remit payment on a monthly basis before the due date.

Important Delinquency Notices

If a charge is added or financial aid is reduced or removed and that increases the balance of the student account, your payment plan will increase accordingly. A computer-generated email is sent to notify of changes to installments.
