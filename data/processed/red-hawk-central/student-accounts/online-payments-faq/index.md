# Online Payments FAQ

## Payments through TouchNet

TouchNet is a web-based, real time service that will provide online, self-service access to the students account and billing history, and allows you to make and/or schedule payments using your Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express cards (processing fee applies) or via an electronic payment from a checking or saving accounts (complimentary). TouchNet will be available to you via [NEST.](http://www.montclair.edu/nest)

The Office of Student Accounts does not accept electronic debit of checking or savings accounts payments by phone, in-person or via credit cards. Credit card or electronic check payments can only be made online.

Can I pay using a check?
:   Montclair State University has contracted with TouchNet to process electronic debit of checking or savings account payments. This service is complimentary; there is no convenience fee for this function. All e-check payments can only be deducted from your personal checking /savings accounts. Checks that are processed with an account other than a personal checking /savings accounts (i.e., credit card number/line of credit, mutual fund accounts, money market accounts, etc. will be rejected; returned check fee applies). Do not use the account number printed on your ATM card.

:   **Returned Check Fee:**
:   You will be assessed a $60.00 return payment fee for any check or electronic payment returned to the University by your bank.
:   Common reasons that payments are returned include but not limited to:
:   * Insufficient funds.
    * Closed or frozen bank account.
    * Stop payment requested at the bank.
    * Incorrect account and/or routing numbers.
:   To avoid the assessment of the return item fee, please double-check that you correctly enter your bank routing and account numbers when making an online payment on TouchNet. Once the payment is made, the University cannot alter and/or cancel the payment.

When I accessed TouchNet to pay by e-check, I was asked for a routing number. What is the routing number?
:   The ABA routing number is a unique identifier for a bank/financial institution. It is typically a nine digit number at the bottom left of your check. It is the second set of numbers that appears on your check other than your checking account number and check number.

Can I pay with a credit card?
:   Credit cards are only accepted online via [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest). Credit/debit cards are not accepted at the University. A $3.00 minimum charge can be made via Master Card, Visa, Discover or American Express. There will be a non-refundable convenience fee of 2.95% added by the servicer to the cardholder’s payment in addition to the principle.

I am paying with a credit card and TouchNet wants me to input a three to four-digit CID number. What is this?
:   The CID Number, also known as the CVV2, is a three-digit value that is printed on the signature panel on the back of Visa, MasterCard and Discover cards immediately following the credit card account number. The American Express CID number is the four-digit value at the front of the card, above the credit card number.

Can I make payments using several different credit cards on the same day?
:   Yes, depending on the terms of your credit card agreement.

Why was my credit card declined?
:   If your credit card was declined at the time of submission, you may want to check the account number and/or CVV numbers to confirm that the information was entered correctly. Also, please re-check that the credit card billing address was correct. You may also need to contact your credit card company as some companies limit the transaction amount per day.

What is an authorized user? How do I give a parent, grandparent or other person access to the payment site?
:   Authorized users may view student account activity and make payments. Students can restrict what authorized users see. They can let authorized users see all account activity or payment history, or both. To protect the privacy of all users, students and their authorized users cannot see or use each other’s saved payment methods. Students can remove authorized users at any time. This prevents the authorized user from further viewing the student’s information.
:   **To grant access to an authorized user:**
:   * [Log into TouchNet](http://www.montclair.edu/online-payment)
    * Select the “Authorized User” tab in the “My Account” menu.
    * Select “Add Authorized User”
    * Enter the email address of the authorized user
    * Click “Continue”
    * Agree to the Terms and Conditions to finalize
    * Click “Continue” A confirmation of your transaction will appear.
:   An email with instructions on how to log in and view your payment plan information will be emailed to the designated person. This person will log in using the email address you provided and the temporary password provided in the email.
:   To protect the privacy of all users, students and their authorized users cannot see or use each other’s saved payment methods. Students can remove authorized users at any time. This prevents the authorized user from further viewing the student’s information.

After completing the above how will parents/guardian/employer make payments online?
:   After submitting the new user’s email address and signing an electronic authorization login, instructions and a randomly generated password will be emailed to the new authorized user. After logging in with the email address and this password, the authorized user will update their profile and password.

Do I have to pay my full balance, or can I make a partial payment?
:   The amount can be changed by highlighting the balance owed and updating the total to reflect:
:   * Payment of the full balance.
    * Making a partial payment.

When I make a payment, will I get a receipt or a confirmation number?
:   A receipt can be printed at the time of payment. A receipt will also be emailed to the address on file.

Can I pay a past due balance on TouchNet?
:   If you wish you make a payment towards a balance incurred in a past semester, visit us at Red Hawk Central or email [redhawkcentral@montclair.edu](mailto:redhawkcentral@montclair.edu).
