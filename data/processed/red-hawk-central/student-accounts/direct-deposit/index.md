## Direct Deposit FAQs

What is Direct Deposit?
:   Direct deposit is also known as Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). It is the transfer of funds from Montclair State University to an individual student’s checking or savings account at a participating bank, savings and loan association or credit union. Direct deposit delivers your money quickly and safely. The difference is a check isn’t printed or mailed.

Are there any costs for my participating in Direct Deposit?
:   No, the program is offered as a service to our students.

I’m interested in Direct Deposit, but I do not know if it is for me?
:   If you have an account, visit your bank or credit union. They can answer your questions about Direct Deposit. If you do not have an account, consider opening one. Many banks offer a variety of accounts, some with little or no fees.

Where do I sign up for Direct Deposit?
:   You can log onto your [NEST](https://www.montclair.edu/nest) account and complete the form online under the Student Accounts tab. You can also visit us in Red Hawk Central and use the terminals on the counter.

The enrollment form asks for my checking or saving account number and my bank’s transit routing number. How do I find that information?
:   Checking and savings account numbers are normally noted at the bottom of checks and deposit slips as well as the nine digit bank transit routing number. In order to avoid confusion on properly recording your bank’s transit routing number, you can bring a voided check or deposit slip to your bank or Student Accounts. Someone will help you complete the form.

When can I use my money?
:   Your money is available for use as soon as it is deposited into your account. You can write checks, withdraw money and transfer into different accounts. Anything you usually do with your money now, you can also do with Direct Deposit.

After I sign up for Direct Deposit, do I have to stay with the same bank?
:   No, you can use Direct Deposit at any bank. If you move your account to another bank, you can change your information by logging onto your [NEST](https://www.montclair.edu/nest) account or by visiting Student Accounts in Red Hawk Central. If you choose to enroll in Direct Deposit but subsequently change your mind, you can deactivate your account also using NEST.

Who should I contact if I have any questions?
:   Please contact [Red Hawk Central](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/contact/) if you have any questions.
