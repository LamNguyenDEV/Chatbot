# Financial Agreement

All Montclair State University (MSU) students are required to read and electronically sign the Montclair State University Financial Responsibility Statement prior to registration for each semester, session or term. (Returning students will be prompted to read and acknowledge this statement when entering the add/drop course registration module in Self-Service Banner.) If the Agreement is declined, registration and further access to the payment gateway will be prohibited. At the time of enrollment, each student understands when they register for any class or classes at Montclair State University or receive any service from Montclair State University, they accept full responsibility for remitting payment by the posted deadline date.

They further understand and agree that any enrollment and acceptance of terms constitutes a promissory note agreement (i.e., a financial obligation) in which Montclair State University is providing them educational services, deferring some or all of the payment obligation for those services, and they promise to pay for all assessed tuition, fees and other associated costs by the published or assigned due date. These costs include but is not limited to tuition, mandatory student fees, room and board, health insurance, residence hall, fines, late fees, and other special fees assessed to a student’s account.

**COVID-19**.  The novel coronavirus or anything that evolves from it (COVID-19) is a life-threatening disease declared by the World Health Organization to be a global pandemic. COVID-19’s contagious nature means that contact with others, or contact with surfaces that have been exposed to the virus, can lead to infection. To prevent infection and subject to limited exceptions, the University is requiring all employees, students and visitors to wear face coverings whenever inside a building or whenever outside a building when 6 feet from another person cannot be maintained.  The new social distance obligations in response to COVID-19 will require the University to reduce capacity in classrooms and may require some or all students to receive instruction remotely. In addition, the University may be required to reduce or suspend academic and non-academic services and activities, relocate instruction to alternative space or deliver instruction remotely, and fully or partially close some or all facilities.  Tuition, fees, housing charges and meal plan charges will not be reduced, refunded or credited on a full or pro-rated basis if Montclair State is required to make any changes due to COVID-19.  Information on the University’s website that may be to the contrary shall not create an enforceable contract against the University.

The document states students are responsible for dropping/withdrawing from courses they do not plan to attend. Students are told if they drop or withdraw from some or all of the classes for which they register, they will be responsible for paying all or a portion of the charges in accordance with the published refund schedule, which specifies 100 percent adjustment is only available for courses dropped prior to the end of Add/Drop period.  Further failure to attend class or review a bill does not absolve students of their financial responsibility as described above.  Registration is only complete upon full funding of enrolled courses.

Financial aid awards are contingent upon continued enrollment and attendance in each class upon which financial aid eligibility was calculated. Dropping any class before completion, may cause financial aid eligibility to decrease, and some or all of the financial aid awarded may be cancelled. If some or all of financial aid is cancelled because of dropping, withdrawing or failing to attend class, **the student will repay all cancelled aid that was disbursed to the account and resulted in a credit balance that was refunded.**

Montclair State University uses the official MSU e-mail as an authorized method of communication with students. All students are responsible for activating this account when accepted at MSU as a student.  Failure to activate the official email does not relieve students of any financial responsibilities to the University.   Therefore, students are responsible for reading the e-mails they receive from MSU in a timely basis, even when classes are not in session.

**This mission statement and attached document outlines the terms and conditions of the financial responsibilities and obligations associated with attending Montclair State University in full.**

Full Financial Agreement

All Montclair State University (the University) students are required to read and electronically sign the Montclair State University Financial Responsibility Statement prior to registration for each semester, session or term. (Returning students will be prompted to read and acknowledge this statement when entering the add/drop course registration module in Self-Service Banner.) If the Agreement is declined, registration and further access to the payment gateway will be prohibited. At the time of enrollment I understand when I register for any class or classes at Montclair State University or receive any service from Montclair State University, I accept full responsibility for remitting payment by the posted deadline date.

**COVID-19**.  The novel coronavirus or anything that evolves from it (COVID-19) is a contagious, life-threatening disease declared by the World Health Organization to be a global pandemic. For the protection of public health, the University will reduce capacity in classrooms and may deliver some or all instruction remotely. In addition, the University may be required to implement changes during the academic year in response to COVID-19, including but not limited to, reduce or suspend academic and non-academic services and activities, relocate instruction to alternative space, modify or convert instruction to remote delivery, and fully or partially close some or all facilities.  I agree that tuition, fees, housing charges, meal plans, and other charges will not be reduced, refunded or credited on a full or pro-rated basis due to any changes implemented by the University.  I further agree that if I drop or withdraw (after the University established deadline for the add/drop period) from some or all of the classes for which I register, I will be responsible for paying my tuition, fees, and other charges in effect at the time I withdraw from or drop courses. I also agree to abide by any safety protocols implemented by the University to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which may include but not be limited to, wearing a face covering, maintaining social distancing, and frequently washing or sanitizing my hands.  I also agree to use technology made available by the University to monitor myself for symptoms, submit to COVID-19 testing when determined appropriate by the University for public health reasons, and cooperate with contact tracing. Lastly, I agree that statements made to the contrary in University marketing materials or on the website do not create an enforceable promise or contract against Montclair State.

I further understand and agree that my enrollment and acceptance of these terms constitutes a promissory note agreement (i.e., a financial obligation) in which Montclair State University is providing me educational services, deferring some or all of my payment obligation for those services, and I promise to pay for all assessed tuition, fees and other associated costs by the published or assigned due date.

This statement outlines the terms and conditions of the financial responsibilities and obligations associated with attending Montclair State University.

### **I UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS:**

## **Payment of Tuition, Fees and Services Rendered**

Upon registration of courses at Montclair State University and/or receipt of any service from the University, I accept full responsibility to pay all tuition, fees and other associated costs assessed as a result of my registration and/or receipt of services by the scheduled due date. These amounts that are owed by me may be an obligation that is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  This includes but is not limited to tuition, mandatory student fees, room and board, health insurance, residence hall penalties, parking fines, late fees, and all other special charges assessed to my account.

### **Effect of Withdrawal/Dropping Classes on My Financial Responsibility**

I understand and agree that if I drop or withdraw (after the University established deadline) from some or all of the classes for which I register, I will be responsible for paying all or a portion of my tuition and fees in accordance with the University’s published tuition adjustment schedule in effect at the time I withdraw from or drop courses. I have read the terms and conditions of Montclair State University’s published tuition adjustment schedule and understand those terms are incorporated herein by reference.

I acknowledge and understand that my absence from or failure to attend class(es) or my non-receipt of a bill from Montclair State University does not defer the due dates or relieve me of my financial responsibilities to the University. I understand I must take action to drop or withdraw.  I also acknowledge that specific programs, such as Study Abroad, Online programs, guaranteed fee curricula and other such special curriculum may have separate and unique adjustment policies with respect to their individual program costs, and that I am likewise responsible for adhering to any specific financial responsibilities outlined in the respective terms and conditions of any such program I agree to participate.

## **Delinquent Account/Collection**

**Financial Hold:** If I fail to pay my student account bill or any monies due and owing Montclair State University by the scheduled due date, the University will place a financial hold on my student account, preventing me from registering for future classes, viewing my grades via NEST  requesting transcripts, and/or receiving my diploma.

**Late Payment Charge:** If I fail to pay my student account bill or any other amounts due and owing from me to the University by their scheduled due dates, Montclair State University will assess a late payment fee, which I agree to pay.

**Collection Fees:** If I fail to pay my student account bill or any other amounts due and owing from me to Montclair State University by their scheduled due dates, I agree to be responsible for paying all reasonable costs that the Montclair State University may incur in connection with the collection of my account, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs and/or fees paid to a collection agency. Collection fees can range from 20% up to 50% of an unpaid balance. My delinquent account will also be reported to one or more of the national credit bureaus.

## **Communication**

Method of Communication: Montclair State University uses the official MSU e-mail as an authorized method of communication with students. All students are responsible for activating this account when accepted at the University as a student.  Failure to activate the official email does not relieve me of my financial responsibilities to the University. Therefore, I am responsible for reading the e-mails that I receive from Montclair State University in a timely basis, even when classes are not in session.

I authorize Montclair State University, and its agents and contractors, to contact me at my current and any future cellular phone number(s), email address(es) or wireless device(s), including by text or media message, regarding my student account(s), any delinquency on such account(s), any other debt I owe to the University, or to receive general information from the University.  By executing this Agreement, I authorize Montclair State University, and its agents and contractors, to use an automated telephone dialing system, and/or an artificial or pre-recorded voice when calling my cellular telephone number or sending me text messages to contact me for any purpose, to my cellular telephone number(s) provided to Montclair State University in the Banner student information system and as updated in accordance with the procedure noted below.  However, I may subsequently withdraw my consent to call my cellular telephone number by submitting my request in writing to the Office of Student Accounts or in writing to the applicable contractor or agent contacting me on behalf of Montclair State University.

**Updating Contact Information:** I am responsible for keeping Montclair State University records up to date with my current physical addresses, email addresses and phone numbers by following the procedure outlined through [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest) in Banner. Students who wish to make a change to their permanent address, or for name and social security changes, please follow the instructions outlined in the name change form on the [Forms page](http://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/forms/) of the Registrar’s office. The linked procedure is incorporated herein by reference. Upon leaving Montclair State University for any reason, it is my responsibility to provide Montclair State University with updated contact information for purposes of continued communication regarding any amounts that remain due and owing to the University.

## **Financial Aid**

**General Conditions:** Any financial aid described as “estimated” on my Financial Aid Award and or invoice does not represent actual or guaranteed payments but is an estimate of the aid I may receive if I meet all of the requirements stipulated by that aid program.

**Federal Aid:** Any federal Title IV or state financial aid that I receive, except for Federal Work Study wages, will first be applied to any outstanding balance on my account for tuition, fees, room and board. Title IV financial aid includes aid from the Pell Grant, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Tuition Aid Grant (TAG), Educational Opportunity Fund (EOF), Stafford Loan, PLUS Loan, and TEACH Grant programs. I authorize Montclair State University to apply my Title IV financial aid to other charges assessed to my student account such as student health insurance, bookstore charges, service fees and fines, and any other education related charges. This authorization will remain in effect until I cease enrollment at Montclair State University or until I formally rescind it by contacting The Office of Student Accounts located at Red Hawk Central.

**Prizes, Awards, Scholarships, and Grants:** All prizes, awards, scholarships and grants awarded to me by Montclair State University will be credited to my student account and applied toward any outstanding balance. My receipt of a prize, award, scholarship or grant is considered a financial resource according to federal Title IV financial aid regulations and may therefore reduce my eligibility for other federal and/or state financial aid (i.e., loans, grants, Federal Work Study), which, if already disbursed to my student account, **must be reversed and returned to the aid source.**

My financial aid award is contingent upon my continued enrollment and attendance in each class upon which my financial aid eligibility was calculated. If I drop any class before completion, my financial aid eligibility may decrease, and some or all of the financial aid awarded to me may be cancelled. If some or all of my financial aid is cancelled because I dropped or failed to attend class, **I agree to repay all cancelled aid that was disbursed to my account and resulted in a credit balance that was refunded to me.**

## **Method of Communication**

I understand and agree to Montclair State University using their authorized e-mail as one of its official methods of communication.   I am responsible for promptly reading the e­mails I receive from Montclair State University or those acting on its behalf.

## **Method of Billing**

Montclair State University uses electronic billing (e-bill) as its official billing method. Therefore, I am responsible for viewing and paying my student account e-bill by the scheduled due date. Failure to review my e-bill does not constitute a valid reason for not paying my bill on time. Invoices are sent electronically via a PDF attachment to the student MSU email.  I further understand that failure to review my e-bill does not constitute a valid reason for not paying my bill on time. E-bill information is available to me on the Montclair State University web site under Red Hawk Central or The Office of Student Accounts.

## **Billing Matters**

Administrative, clerical or technical billing errors do not absolve me of my financial responsibility to pay the correct amount of tuition, fees and other associated financial obligations assessed as a result of my registration at the Montclair State University

**I Agree to Pay the Following Fees:** These fees are immediately due and payable and must be paid to restore my student account to good standing and terminate any Hold.

**a) Returned Payment and Stop Payment Charge:**

If a payment to my student account is returned, dishonored or otherwise rejected by a financial institution for any reason (regardless of the form/method of payment), I agree to immediately pay the obligation I sought to pay by the returned, dishonored or rejected payment, plus any financial institution charges Montclair State University incurs due to the dishonored or otherwise rejected payment, plus a returned payment fee of $60.00.

**b)** **Collection Charges/Fees:**

I agree that Montclair State University may refer my past due account for collection, including, but not limited to, authorizing legal action against me for collection of any amounts not paid when due. In the event that my account is referred to a collection agency, I will be responsible for and agree to pay the collection agency fees in addition to the sums referred for collection. I also agree in the event my account is referred to an attorney for collection, I will be responsible for reasonable attorneys’ fees determined by a court together with court costs and disbursements as permitted by law.

**Reporting Past Due Accounts To Credit Reporting Bureaus:** I agree that Montclair State University may report my failure to pay Montclair State University as agreed to credit reporting bureaus.

## **Privacy Rights & Responsibilities**

Montclair State University is bound by the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html), which prohibits the University from releasing any personally identifiable information from my education record without my written permission, except in those instances specifically allowed under FERPA. Therefore, if I want Montclair State University to share information from my education record with someone else, I must provide written permission by following the procedure outlined at [our FERPA policy webpage](https://www.montclair.edu/policies/all-policies/family-education-rights-and-privacy-act/).

## **IRS Form 1098-T**

I agree to provide my Social Security number (SSN) or taxpayer identification number (TIN) to Montclair State University upon request as required for Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1098-T reporting purposes. I will provide my SSN or TIN on an IRS Form W-9S, Request for Student’s or Borrower’s Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, or on such other document requested by Montclair State University. In addition, I will make the requisite certifications, if applicable, required on such form or document. If I fail to provide my SSN or TIN to Montclair State University, I agree to pay or reimburse the Montclair State University for any and all fines assessed or imposed against the Montclair State University as a result of my failing to provide the required or requested information and/or certification. I consent to receive my annual IRS Form 1098-T electronically from Montclair State University via their third-party partner Heartland ECSI.

## **Student Age**

If I am younger than the applicable age of majority when I execute this agreement, I agree that some or all of the services provided by the Montclair State University are a necessity and I am contractually obligated to pay them and may not void this agreement.

## **Entire Agreement**

This agreement is the entire arrangement between me and Montclair State University with respect to my payment and enrollment obligations to the University and supersedes all prior understandings, representations, negotiations and correspondence between me and Montclair State University related to other than any financial aid award which is evidenced by a separate agreement. This agreement shall not be modified or affected by any course of dealing or course of performance. Unless I am required to execute another student financial responsibility agreement at the beginning of an academic year or term, this agreement will cover my current and future enrollment at Montclair State University.
