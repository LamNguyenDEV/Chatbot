## Frequently Asked Questions

**What regulations are used by Montclair State University to establish residency for in state charges?**
:   Montclair State University (MSU) determines state residency for tuition purposes according to New Jersey Administrative Code 9A:5-1.1-1.2, which requires that a student must be legally domiciled in the state of New Jersey for at least twelve (12) months immediately prior to enrollment in order to be charged in-state tuition. All those domiciled outside of the state are charged out-of-state tuition.

**What does Domicile mean?**
:   Domicile means: The place where a person has their true, fixed, permanent home and principal living establishment, and to which, whenever they is absent, he/she has the intention of returning.

**Is financial aid awarded based on being a New Jersey resident?**
:   Some financial aid has state eligibility requirements, including a determination of residency. A determination of state residency is made by the admissions office once a student is admitted to attend Montclair State University. The New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (NJHESAA) may require certain documents to establish proof of residency. These same documents may also be required by the Office of Student Accounts and/or the Admissions Office to establish proof of residency.

**I am an international student; can I qualify for in state status?**
:   Aside from H-4 dependent children, international students are not eligible to pay in-state tuition unless they receive Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status (a green card) and comply with the definition of “domicile” as described above. Any other international student in nonimmigrant status (F-1, J-1, O-3, H-4 [dependent spouse], etc.) will be classified as a nonresident for the purpose of assessment of tuition unless the student has been otherwise notified by the Office of International Engagement. H-4 dependent children (not spouses) who meet the following criteria are also eligible for in-state tuition according to New Jersey S2555, signed into law on January 21, 2020: 1) attended a New Jersey high school for three or more years; 2) graduated from a New Jersey high school or received the equivalent of a high school diploma in New Jersey; and 3) register[ed] as an entering student or are currently enrolled in a public institution of higher education not earlier than the fall semester of the 2013-2014 academic year.

**Is there a deadline to submit an appeal or affidavit to amend residency?**
:   Students admitted as a non-resident and have been enrolled at Montclair State for a minimum of 12 months may request a change in residency status by completing an affidavit or appeal and providing all necessary documentation by the end of the add drop deadline as published on the university’s academic calendar. If approved for NJ Residency, it will apply to the current and or next future term possible. Retroactive assessments are not performed.

**What does it mean to be matriculated student?**
:   A matriculated student has been accepted for admission to the College, has registered in a major and is pursuing courses toward a degree or certificate. Students must maintain good academic standing to keep their matriculated status.

**What is Dream Act and DACA?**
:   The DREAM Act (acronym for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) is an American legislative proposal for a process for granting residency status to qualifying immigrants who entered the United States as minors.
:   Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is an [American immigration policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States) that allows some individuals with unlawful presence in the United States after being brought to the country as children to receive a renewable two-year period of [deferred action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_action) from [deportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation) and become eligible for a [work permit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_authorization_document) in the U.S. To be eligible for the program, recipients cannot have felonies or serious misdemeanors on their records. Unlike the proposed [DREAM Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act), DACA does not provide a path to citizenship for recipients, known as Dreamers.

**What is the dream and promise Act of 2019?**
:   Introduced in the House (03/12/2019) this bill cancels and prohibits removal proceedings against certain aliens and provides such aliens with a path toward permanent resident status. For such aliens who apply, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall grant permanent residence status.

**Is DACA and dream act the same?**
:   Unlike the proposed DREAM Act, DACA does not provide a path to citizenship for recipients, known as Dreamers. … Congress failed to act and the time extension expired on March 5, 2018, but the phase-out of DACA has been put on hold by several courts.

**MSU may require students to complete the FAFSA to apply for institutional scholarships. If I have been granted DACA status and have received a social security number, can I complete the FAFSA?**
:   Since you have a social security number, you can complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). There is no penalty for doing so, but undocumented students – including DACA recipients – are not eligible for federal aid. If you choose to complete the FAFSA, the Federal Student Aid office provides [specific instructions.](/red-hawk-central/financial-aid/nj-dreamers/)

**Can Dream Act students get federal Pell Grant?**
:   No, DACA recipients cannot access federal financial aid, grants, or loans by completing the FAFSA form. However, getting a Student Aid Report (SAR) by completing the (FAFSA) can open many doors to access private and other institutional funding!

**Is it safe to identify myself as undocumented when I apply to college?**
:   Yes it absolutely is. Almost all colleges (with the possible exception of for-profits) will keep your personal information safe throughout the application process. In many cases, it’s important to let your college know you are undocumented so they can discuss options with you and offer all the support they have available to dreamers.

**What if my parents are undocumented, but I have citizenship. Can I still fill out the FAFSA and receive financial aid?**
:   Yes! If you’re a dependent student living with parents who are undocumented, you can still fill out the FAFSA using your social security number. In the part of the parent info section that asks for your parents social security number, enter all zeroes (000-00-0000) and then print out the FAFSA and mail to it FAFSA headquarters instead of signing your FAFSA with an FSA ID.
