# Tuition and Fee Appeal

## Policy Statement

After classes have begun, a student may experience an extenuating circumstance beyond their control that prohibits the student’s continued attendance at Montclair State University. In such a case, after the student has already withdrawn from their course(s) the student may be eligible to receive a tuition adjustment by filing a Tuition/Fee Appeal within Six Months from the last date of the semester in which they are appealing.

Montclair State University will review a Tuition/Fee Appeal request provided the student submits supporting documentation pertaining to the reason for appealing. Appeals that are incomplete or do not have substantial information for a legitimate appeal will be denied.

## Appeal Process

All appeals are discussed with several offices within Montclair State University. Such offices are the Office of Student Accounts, Dean’s Office, Financial Aid, Registrar and other departments that are relevant to your particular appeal. Representatives from these respective offices will be contacted regarding information pertaining to your appeal as we deem appropriate.

When submitting your Tuition Appeal supporting paperwork is required. Be sure to provide all documentation such as letters from doctors, hospital statements, copies of incorrect or misleading university publications, etc. you feel may support your appeal. For example, a statement from an advisor is needed when a counseling error is the basis of the request. If Montclair State University requires additional information from you, a request will be made to your Montclair State University email address.  
All decisions are final.
