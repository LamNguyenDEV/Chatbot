### Important Information

* **All residents must have a meal plan:** Students living in University-owned residence halls, apartments and houses at both the Montclair and Bloomfield campuses, are required to maintain a Meal Plan. Not only is a meal plan required for all our students living on campus, a specific meal plan may also be stipulated based on the credit hours earned or by the building where the student is housed.
