# Late Fees

Students are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with their accounts before the start of the term and review regularly throughout the semester as changes may occur after payment is made due to schedule adjustments. If courses are added after the payment due date, students must remit payment for the additional class within 48 hours.

## Information about Late Fees

Late fees are assessed once per semester and can be incurred anytime after the Payment Deadline. Accounts with balances that are not paid in full by the semester due date will be subject to:

* A Hold placed on your account, which will result in the denial of registration, requests for transcripts, re-admission, viewing grades, diplomas and/or certifications until the past-due balance is satisfied.
* A one-time late fee.
* Should a student account be referred to a collection agency, they will be responsible for paying all agency costs in addition to their account balance to be satisfied and any applicable financial Holds released. Such costs may include but are not limited to, late fees, costs associated with collection, attorney’s fees, and litigation costs (estimated to be 20%-40% of the amount placed in collection). As stated on the [collection web page](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/student-accounts/collections/), the account is referred to a third-party pre-collection service and/or an external collection agency.

### Late Fee Appeals

Students seeking to appeal a late fee must submit a [Late Fee Waiver Request](https://bannersso.montclair.edu/ssomanager/saml/login?relayState=/c/auth/SSB?pkg=bzsklate.P_late) within 30 days of the late fee assessment date.

* Only online requests will be considered.
* Students will receive a confirmation email after submitting an appeal.
* A decision email will follow within 15 business days
* Approvals are immediately visible on [NEST](http://nest.montclair.edu/).
* All decisions are final.

Outstanding balances, including late fees, will result in a financial hold on your account, which may restrict registration, diploma release and transcript access. Balances must be resolved before holds can be lifted.
