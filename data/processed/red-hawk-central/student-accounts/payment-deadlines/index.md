If You Decide Not to Attend Any or All of Your Courses

* You must officially withdraw through [NEST](https://www.montclair.edu/nest) or submit a written notice to the [Registrar’s Office](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/registrar/) located in Red Hawk Central.
  + Students who do not withdraw or take a leave of absence according to policy, forfeit all rights to any type of adjustment to their account and will be responsible for meeting all financial obligations.
  + It is the student’s responsibility to officially drop/withdraw from their classes by the applicable deadlines. Students who withdraw from classes and have received financial aid must also visit Red Hawk Central as some of your financial aid may need to be returned. Any balance that results from a reduction in financial aid is the responsibility of the student.
* Financial aid awards are contingent upon continued enrollment and attendance in each class upon which aid eligibility was calculated. Dropping any class before completion may decrease eligibility, and some or all of the financial aid awarded may be canceled. If some or all financial aid is canceled because a student drops or fails to attend class, **all canceled aid that was disbursed to the account and resulted in a credit balance that was refunded will need to be paid back to Montclair State University.**
