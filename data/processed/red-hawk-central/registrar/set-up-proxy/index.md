# Proxy Information

Per the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://www.montclair.edu/policies/all-policies/family-education-rights-and-privacy-act/) your permission is required to allow a family member, spouse or guardian access to view your Educational Record through [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest). Once set up, they become your “Proxy.” They can view the records that you allow access to, but they may not update or take any action on your behalf. You may indicate an end date for your Proxy to have access. If you leave that field blank, they will continue to have access until you revise. Access to your information is governed by Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 USC §1232; CFR 99, HEA, including but not limited to Sections 483 and 494, and pursuant to the Federal Tax Information (FTI) under section 6103(l)(13) of title 26.

Montclair State University fully believes that every student is responsible for the management of their own academic record and academic career. There may be some instances in which you want to designate a Proxy for a limited period of time.

* **Granting Proxy:** This gives the University permission to speak to a family member or guardian of your choice about your student record.
