# Holds

## **What Are Holds?**

Holds are placed on a student’s account when students have not completed necessary requirements established by the University or have not paid their outstanding bill.

1. Log into NEST and then Degree Works to view your Hold.
2. On Degree Works, you will see a column titled “Holds” which will tell you what type of Hold you have on your account

### **Can I register before I take the required action to remove the Hold?**

Every Hold is different. To understand what is required of you, call Red Hawk Central [973-655-7600](tel:973-655-7600) or [redhawkcentral@montclair.edu](mailto:RedHawkCentral@montclair.edu) or the appropriate department (shown as originator on your account) to understand how the Hold affects you. Students with an outstanding balance are unable to register or receive transcripts because they are blocked by Financial Holds. It is important for you to take action immediately.

## **Common Types of “Holds”**

Advising Hold

Advising Holds are typically placed on student accounts for academic reasons. If you have an advising Hold on your account you should reach out to your advisor to discuss options for having this Hold removed.
