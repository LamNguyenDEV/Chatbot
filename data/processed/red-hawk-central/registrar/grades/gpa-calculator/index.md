# GPA Calculator

Use this GPA calculator to estimate the outcome of your academic statistics for one semester only. The calculator should be used as a tool to assist in planning your semester goals and also to project an unofficial GPA. These calculations should not be considered your official GPA at Montclair State University or any other institution. Note that the official academic GPA is calculated on a 4.000 scale.

If you are using this GPA calculator to estimate your Financial Aid GPA for Satisfactory Academic Progress either contact Red Hawk Central or read the [**Financial Aid-Satisfactory Academic Progress web page**](/red-hawk-central/financial-aid/sap-regulations/satisfactory-academic-progress-sap/).
