# Registration FAQs

What if you are blocked from repeating a course that you have taken one or more time in prior terms?
:   Per University Academic Policy, undergraduate students are permitted to repeat a course only in which they have received a final grade of D+, D, D- or F. They are not permitted to repeat a course in which they received a C- or higher without special permission. Graduate students are not permitted to repeat courses without special permission. (Certain “repeatable” courses, like a music lessons, independent studies, coops, special topics courses are exceptions).
:   For permission to repeat a course for which you have earned a C- or higher, see either the Dean’s Office of the College/School of your major or the Dean’s Office of the College/School in which the course is offered. Graduate students must see the Dean’s Office of the Graduate School.
:   The request to Repeat a class, or to register for an Independent study can be initiated in your NEST account under “Manage your record.”

How are Permits handled?
:   Permits may be issued by Department Chairpersons. Students who wish to obtain a permit to enter a closed course, or a course in which they have not met the pre-req, co-req or other requirements, may visit the appropriate academic department for assistance. Once the permit has been entered, students are required to register for the course through [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest) before the end of the add/drop period.

How do I find my PIN? (Students with Mandatory advising ONLY)
:   Students who are required to have mandatory advising will need a Registration PIN to register. While you are meeting with your advisor, you will receive this PIN. Each semester, a new PIN will be issued and needed for registration.
:   For more information on PINS, please visit the [Registration PINs page](/red-hawk-central/registrar/registration/registration-pins/).
