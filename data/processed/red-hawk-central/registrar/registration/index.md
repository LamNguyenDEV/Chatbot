# Registration

## **Registering for Classes**

All students must register for class and are expected to do so each term including fall, winter, spring and summer.

Learn how to [register for classes via NEST](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTAzXz9dLnW8syg1Zwk7BFJQvKoGdVmgNMktAY9kiAum8_lRGSADUT69i9J5F_cYAQTAzsue5qWa7Av/pub). **No student should be attending a course for which they are not registered.**

## Before You Register…

Be prepared and ready to go when your registration time begins. Check the steps…

Step 1

Review the Schedule of Courses

[**Check the Schedule of Courses**](https://student-ssb-regis.montclair.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/term/termSelection?mode=search) and plan your classes. We will let you know when it goes live.

### How To Look Up Classes

We have created a step-by-step instructional video on how to look up classes using the “Look Up Classes” option in [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest). This guide walks you through all the steps from logging into [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest) to recording your Course Registration Numbers necessary for registration.

Step 2

Talk to Your Academic Advisor

Developing a plan for completing your degree with the help of your academic advisor is critical to your success. It is highly encouraged, and in some cases mandatory, that you meet with your Academic advisor before registering. Review the course schedule with your advisor. Your academic advisor and their contact information is available in your Degree Works audit via [**NEST**](http://www.montclair.edu/nest).

Step 3

Find Out if You Need a Registration PIN

If academic advising is mandatory for you, your academic advisor will provide you with your own unique registration PIN that will enable you to register for courses in Banner, via NEST. This registration PIN is needed to unlock the system to you, and only you, to sign up for your classes. For more information on PINs, please visit the [**Registration PINs web page.**](/red-hawk-central/registrar/registration/registration-pins/)

**Please Note:** Registration PINs are unique to a semester’s registration. PINs from previous semesters will not work.

Step 4

Take Care of Holds

Holds are placed on student accounts when students have not paid their outstanding bill, or fine (ie: parking ticket, library fine, etc.) or completed paperwork required by the University. Some of these Holds will prevent you from registering for classes. For more information, please visit the [**Holds web page.**](/red-hawk-central/registrar/holds/)

## Other Important Registration Information

### Search for and View Schedule of Classes

Having trouble searching for classes? Learn How to [Search for and View Schedule of Classes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRPWL1KTApf1PrZdJFb6wu9FptHXLUr2SCoTJ8nZUjJZMzYpIToHmyLaQbJYpPVD9FskEw70ZtCNzWq/pub)!

### Waitlist

A waitlist is when a student may request a seat even after the class is full to be put on a waitlist if a spot opens up. If a space in the course becomes available, the first student on the waitlist will receive an email notification from the Registrar regarding the open space. Waitlisting does not guarantee that a seat will become available for which you can register. The waitlist will always favor seniors and will recalibrate the order if a senior puts themselves on the list. Department chairs and Deans may change the order of the waitlist if it is clear that someone higher on the list needs to have that seat in order to graduate.

[Get More Information about the Waitlist](/red-hawk-central/waitlist-for-students/).
