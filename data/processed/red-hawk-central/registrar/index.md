# Registrar

The Office of the Registrar provides support and services to students, alumni, faculty, staff and other constituents in an efficient, professional, ethical and courteous manner.

We design and implement efficient systems for student registration, class scheduling and room assignments; create and maintain accurate academic records and **ensures** the integrity of the Montclair State University degree, while supporting the mission and goals of the University and complying with the State of New Jersey and other regulatory agencies.

As the stewards of the Universityâ€™s academic records, we ensure the accuracy, integrity and security of those records. As partners in education, we facilitate learning and academic progress. As members of the Montclair State University community, we promote equity and fairness by supporting the development and consistent application of effective policies and processes. Accountability, in all areas, is the hallmark of the office.
