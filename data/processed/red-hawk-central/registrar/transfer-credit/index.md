# Transfer Credit

## Transferring Credit to Montclair State University

### General Information

Students may transfer credit from regionally accredited colleges or universities to Montclair State University, provided the coursework meets the minimum required standards for transfer credit. Students may also transfer credits from college coursework completed in high school or certain exams. Credits earned from foreign institutions prior to a student’s enrollment at Montclair will be evaluated only after receiving an official [NACES-accredited organization](http://naces.org/members) course-by-course evaluation.

Currently enrolled Montclair students may transfer college credit from another regionally accredited institution by completing the Coursework at Another Institution process. Coursework at Another Institution is also required for students participating in Study Abroad or National Student Exchange programs. It is strongly recommended that the Coursework at Another Institution process is completed before taking the coursework elsewhere to ensure the courses will be accepted.

Transfer credit will not be awarded based upon unofficial transcripts or from a high school transcript. Any coursework listed as in-progress or incomplete on an official transcript will not be posted to a student’s Montclair record. Montclair does not accept transfer credit from non-regionally accredited institutions.

For more information regarding undergraduate transfer coursework, please refer to the [Transfer Student Policy](https://www.montclair.edu/policies/all-policies/transfer-students/) and/or [Undergraduate Admissions](https://www.montclair.edu/admissions/apply-and-check-status/how-to-apply/transfer-applicants/).

NYU Language Proficiency Exam

### NYU Language Proficiency Exam

Students who are native speakers or are fluent in a foreign language may take the NYU Language Proficiency Exam to earn credit. In order to be awarded credit, students must earn a minimum required score of six. Students may take the 12-point or 16-point exam. The official score reports must be submitted to Rashida Batte-Bowden, Associate Registrar, at [batter@montclair.edu](mailto:batter@montclair.edu) for credit to be posted. Scores will not be accepted when sent directly by the student. Students will receive a notification when the scores have been posted.

Credit Evaluations

Please review our [Transfer FAQs](https://www.montclair.edu/admissions/transfer-faqs/) for commonly asked questions. Graduate students should refer to the [Graduate Policy Manual](https://www.montclair.edu/graduate-students/academic-policies-procedures-guidelines/) for transfer credit information.

### Transfer Students

Transfer students are required to submit official college transcripts and be admitted to the University to receive a transfer credit evaluation. Credit will not be evaluated for courses in-progress or for courses that do not meet the minimum transfer credit requirements. Final, official transcripts from all previously attended colleges/universities are required for incoming transfer students.

Transfer credit evaluations are completed within 10 business days of the transfer student’s acceptance, provided the student has submitted an official college transcript from their prior institution(s). Please note: Transfer credit evaluations for incoming fall transfer students will start to be released during the spring as curricular updates for the upcoming academic year must first be completed to ensure the most accurate evaluation possible.

### Credits Earned in High School

Students who earned credit in high school must submit their enrollment deposit and their official college transcript in order for credit to be evaluated and posted to their record. Credit will not be awarded based upon a high school transcript or an unofficial college transcript. Official or verified score reports are required to post credits earned by exams in high school, such as Advanced Placement (AP).

### Credit Evaluation Appeals

Students have the right to [appeal decisions](https://www.montclair.edu/admissions/transfer-credit-appeals-process/) regarding the acceptance of their transfer credits.
