# Diploma/University Certificate

Diplomas and University Certificates will be mailed directly from the diploma company to those students who have no outstanding financial obligations approximately six-eight weeks after your conferment date. Covers for diplomas are given out at Commencement. You may track your Diploma/University Certificate order at [DiploMatic](http://www.michaelsutter.com/montclair).

Students can also order an official eDiploma at DiploMatic for a one-time charge of $3.50. Your Montclair State University eDiploma is a signed and certified PDF version of your diploma which can be used for easy diploma verification purposes. You will receive your eDiploma within minutes of placing your order, and can share it as often as you need.

## Need a Replacement?

Diplomas for all students who have applied to graduate will be automatically mailed to the location you decide. Alumni can order a replacement diploma easily online at [DiploMatic](http://www.michaelsutter.com/montclair) for a charge of $11.78 plus shipping and handling. Once your hold(s) have been lifted, email us at [registrar@mail.montclair.edu](mailto:registrar@mail.montclair.edu) so that your diploma may be released. Please include your Montclair State University student identification number (CWID) in your email. You will be able to choose Standard Delivery or Express Overnight.
