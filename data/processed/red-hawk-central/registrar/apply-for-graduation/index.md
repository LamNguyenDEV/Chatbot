# Apply to Graduate

It is the student’s responsibility to complete the curriculum prescribed in the University catalog in effect, or as modified, when they matriculated. Students who will be completing their curriculum requirements for degrees, teacher certification or post-baccalaureate certificates must complete the Application to Graduate through their [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest) account in order to be evaluated for completion of requirements and subsequently become eligible for degree conferment, certificate or recommendation for teacher certification.

**Please Note:** Once a student has applied to graduate, they are not eligible to register for continued coursework unless they have been accepted to the Graduate School, or applied as a second BA or visiting student. Any extraneous coursework will be administratively dropped by the Office of the Registrar.
