## Important

* Students who drop a course through [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest) are responsible for reviewing their schedule to make certain that they have indeed dropped the course.
* If you have a hold that is preventing your withdrawal, contact [registration@montclair.edu](mailto:registration@montclair.edu) for assistance. Withdrawals are completed by returning to your current term registration in NEST and requesting the WD option.
* If you need assistance adding a class to your schedule during the first week of each semester, you may need to contact your academic advisor. [Schedule an appointment on Navigate today!](https://www.montclair.edu/navigate/)

**Please Note:** Notification to the instructor or a “stop payment” of a check does not constitute an official withdrawal from the University or withdrawal from individual courses.

Drop&sol;Withdrawal Policy

**New first-year students, please visit your college advising office or faculty advisor for assistance with drop/add.**

Courses dropped through the Final Add/Drop deadline will be removed from the records. Courses withdrawn after the Final Add/Drop deadline through the tenth week of the semester will be recorded as WD’s.

* [Refunds and Withdrawal Policy](https://www.montclair.edu/policies/all-policies/refunds-and-withdrawals/)
* [View Medical Withdrawal Policy](https://www.montclair.edu/policies/all-policies/medical-withdrawal-policy/)

Leave of Absence&sol;Withdrawal

**Undergraduate Students** may take a leave of absence for one semester (fall and/or spring). All requests for a withdrawal or leave of absence from the University must be completed online in NEST. Please view our [How-To Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTR3ORvcXmYXTJYIWTZ7kyb11xDc-1YczdOhn4ry-Ik1kHAv7FvBxobMySo71wTymltP-Hw_tFzRk8Q/pub) if you need more assistance.

Once submitted, your request will be reviewed by a member of your college or school’s academic advising/student success team.

Students who take a leave of absence for one semester do not need to apply for readmission and can simply register for the next upcoming semester during the registration period. Students who have officially withdrawn or been away for more than two semesters, must apply for readmission.

**Graduate Students** requesting a leave of absence or withdrawal from the University must contact [The Graduate School.](https://gradschool.montclair.edu/gradweb/forms/formslogin.php?to=https%3A%2F%2Fgradschool.montclair.edu%2Fgradweb%2Fforms%2Floa.php)

**Please Note:** Notification to University College or The Graduate School does not constitute an official withdrawal from individual courses.
