## **Definitions**

**Official Withdrawal/Leave of Absence – Fall Semester** **Official Withdrawal:** is when you withdraw from ALL of your classes via NEST and complete the [Withdrawal/Leave of Absence process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTR3ORvcXmYXTJYIWTZ7kyb11xDc-1YczdOhn4ry-Ik1kHAv7FvBxobMySo71wTymltP-Hw_tFzRk8Q/pub) for the semester in question.

**Official Withdrawal Date Policy:** The official withdrawal date is final and cannot be changed under any circumstances\*. If a student officially withdraws from the university, the Financial Aid Office must use this date to complete the required Return of Title IV (R2T4) calculations.

**Please Note:** Any academic withdrawal or institutional refund granted by the University through an appeal is a **separate process** and does not affect the federal R2T4 calculation.

\*If a student can prove they never attended the University, they must notify the Financial Aid Office immediately.

**Unofficial Withdrawals:** is when a student leaves without notice or ends the semester with “0” credits through any combination of “F’s” and/or “WD’s” for **all** courses.

* The Federal calculation will apply for federal financial aid (Pell, FSEOG, Stafford Loans and/or PLUS Loans). The University may use any of the following dates that best represents the last documentable date of attendance:
  + Last date of attendance of an academic-related activity
  + Date provided by an instructor
  + Midpoint of the semester

* NJ State aid (TAG, EOF, NJSTARS, GSG and/or Distinguished Scholarship) **not** disbursed must be canceled based on NJHESAA policy.
  + If the University is unable to document a student’s last date of attendance in an academically related activity, 50% of the total State aid will be returned in accordance with NJHESAA policy.

*In many cases, you will owe money to the University.*

**What counts as academically related activity?**

**Examples of Academic Engagement:**·

* Attending a live (in-person or online) class, lab, or lecture with instructor-student interaction
* Submitting assignments
* Taking exams or assessments
* Participating in interactive tutorials, webinars, or group work assigned by the school
* Communicating with an instructor about academic topics
* **Not considered academic engagement:**
  + Withdrawing from some courses (not all courses)
  + Living in campus housing
  + Using a meal plan
  + Logging into a class without participating
  + Attending academic advising without academic discussion

**Partial Withdrawals**

If you are a full-time student (12 credits or more) with disbursed State Grant funds who withdraws from some of your classes during the tuition pro-ration period, you will lose a portion of your State Grants and, in most cases, you will owe money to the University.

Impact of Withdrawals on Standards of Academic Progress (SAP) – Withdrawals and F grades impact your continued eligibility for financial aid due to federal requirements. Review the [SAP policies](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/paying-for-college/sap-regulations/).

### **Modular Courses**

**Withdrawal Policy for Modular Courses**

Be aware that the withdrawal dates vary for any courses or programs offered in a modular format (courses that do not span the full term). Federal return of funds will be calculated based on the dates for individual courses/programs per federal regulations. Federal financial aid eligibility is based on continued attendance in all scheduled modules. Failure to complete or begin scheduled modules may result in the recalculation of your financial aid. State return of fund rules also apply.

**What Happens If You Withdraw from a Modular Course?**

A student is considered to have withdrawn when a student ceases enrollment at any point prior to completion of the payment period unless the student:

* Successfully completes 6 credits in the payment period or
* Successfully completes one course or a combination of courses that includes 49 percent or more of the payment period

If a student officially withdraws from all modules, or is considered to have stopped attending, the Financial Aid Office is required to perform a Return of Title IV (R2T4) calculation.

The withdrawal date used for R2T4 purposes will be based on the last date of attendance or the official withdrawal date, whichever is applicable.

If a student completes at least one module that spans 49% or more of the term (or all modules scheduled), they may be considered not withdrawn for federal aid purposes.

### **Impact of Withdrawals on Standards of Academic Progress**

* Understand that withdrawals and F grades will impact your continued eligibility for financial aid due to the requirements of Standards of Academic Progress (SAP). Attempted credits that are not completed with a passing grade reduce both your SAP GPA and your progress to completing your degree.
