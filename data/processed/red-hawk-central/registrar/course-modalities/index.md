# Course Modalities

Hawk To Hawk

* **Hawk2Hawk (H2H):** Traditional face-to-face (F2F) class setting to be held entirely in-person, on campus during the days and times listed.

Hybrid Instruction

Most of the following instructional modalities (Hawk2Hawk, HawkLIVE, HawkMIX or HawkFIELD) **will require some in-person, on-campus class attendance, as provided by the instructor’s in-person attendance policy in the class syllabus. If you need or prefer to take classes offered completely online see the “Online Instruction” section below.**

* **HawkLIVE (HLV):** Face-to-face (F2F), synchronous instruction held simultaneously in-person and online. Due to limitations to the number of people allowed to be present in a classroom at one time, expect a regular, rotating schedule. **You must come in or log in to your class during the days and times listed on your schedule.**
* **HawkFIELD (HFD):** Courses that have off-campus, field elements and often class sessions for mentoring and supervision, for example, student teaching clinical activities, internships, co-ops and the like.

**Please Note:** Look carefully for any location, day, or time requirements when registering for class.

Online Instruction

* **HawkSYNC Online – Synchronous (SON):** A fully online class that meets at specific days and times and requires you to log on to be remotely “in class” with your instructor and classmates.
* **HawkASYNC Online – Asynchronous (AON):** A fully online class that does not require you to log on at a specific day or time. Your instructor will create assignments and deadlines for you to complete and meet in your own time.
