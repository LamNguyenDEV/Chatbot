# Outside Scholarships

# Outside Scholarships

Financial Aid, including grants, student or parent loans, and scholarships, may be used to offset educational expenses. Estimated financial aid will be reflected on the student account summary via [NEST](https://www.montclair.edu/nest). If your charges exceed your financial aid, you must pay the balance by the due date to avoid late fees. Please come see us at Red Hawk Central or email us at [redhawkcentral@montclair.edu](mailto:redhawkcentral@montclair.edu) if you are making changes to your schedule. This may also change the amount of potential aid you will receive.

## **Guidelines for Outside Scholarships**

Students are required to submit copies of all scholarship notification letters to the Student Accounts Office. Information can be submitted via email to [studentaccou@montclair.edu](mailto:studentaccou@montclair.edu) or in person at the Cashier’s window.

**These letter(s) should include the following:**

* Name of Scholarship.
* CWID Number.
* Amount of Scholarship.
* If information is available, how the scholarship will be disbursed. (i.e. paper check or electronic transmission of funds -EFT)
* If the scholarship will be made payable to the school.
* If the entire amount of the scholarship will be sent at the beginning of the year or semester.

**Please be aware** that any outside scholarship awards you receive will be considered financial resources and may result in a reduction of the need-based financial aid you are offered. If the total amount of your outside scholarships exceeds your demonstrated financial need and/or the cost of attendance, we will adjust your financial aid package to adhere to federal and state regulations.

## **Submitting Checks to Montclair State University**

Scholarship checks should be made payable to Montclair State University with the student’s full name, CWID, and semester(s) to which the funds should be applied. Scholarship checks should be mailed to the address below:

* Montclair State University  
  Student Accounts Office  
  Attn: Cashier’s Office  
  1 Normal Ave, Room 200  
  Montclair, NJ 07043

Scholarship checks made payable to the student and Montclair State University must be endorsed by the student before the funds can be applied to their account. The Student Accounts Office will contact the student when their endorsement is needed.

**Please Note:** Scholarship checks made payable to the student only cannot be accepted.

## Scholarships Requiring Documentation

### Enrollment and Academic Verification

Some scholarships may require an invoice or billing statement from Montclair State University before sending payment to the school. This requirement is typically noted in the notification letter. Below are some commonly requested documents:

* **Billing Statement or Invoice:** Requests for an invoice must be noted in the notification letter along with the agency’s contact and billing address information.
* **Verification Forms:** Verification forms can be emailed to [thirdpty@montclair.edu](mailto:thirdpty@montclair.edu).
* **Transcripts or Certification of Enrollment:** Please be advised that Red Hawk Central cannot issue official transcripts or enrollment certifications. Students may submit a request through the [National Student Clearinghouse](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/registrar/request-transcripts/) for official transcripts. The Enrollment Verification form is available via NEST (Registration > Degree Audit & Transcripts page). Students can access information pertaining to their academic standing, financial aid awards, cost of attendance, and more on NEST.
