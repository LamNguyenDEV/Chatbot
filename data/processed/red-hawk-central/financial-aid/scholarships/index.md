# Scholarships

Scholarship funds are often based on a specific skill or ability, a major of study or a separate application. Scholarships do not need to be paid back. Eligibility requirements and amounts awarded vary. Here, you’ll find the information you need to understand the different types of scholarships offered, including university scholarships, school and college scholarships and scholarships from outside, private sources.
