This tool brings together external and internal scholarships in one convenient portal for our Red Hawks to access as much funding as possible. The best part? By filling out your ScholarshipUniverse profile, you’ll be matched with best fit opportunities so that you can streamline your efforts to obtain additional aid – all in a matter of minutes.

Who Can Use ScholarshipUniverse&quest;

Students – undergraduate and graduate – can access ScholarshipUniverse throughout their entire time at Montclair, beginning once you are deposited and have set up your Montclair NetID and password.

What Are the Benefits of Using ScholarshipUniverse&quest;

By setting up your profile, an adaptive matching engine will filter and display scholarship opportunities tailored specifically to you, your interests, goals and accomplishments so you can review the options that are the best fit for you. You only have to input your information once and ScholarshipUniverse will send it to any scholarships you apply to. Feeling busy? The platform guides you through a secure process, sending you alerts and communications to keep you on track towards scholarship success. You can log in any time to track the status of your scholarship applications.

When Should I Apply for Scholarships&quest;

Scholarships are added throughout the year and the platform is available to you 24/7. We recommend that you log in to ScholarshipUniverse at least once a week to stay up to date on any new scholarships that are posted and apply before their deadline dates. During the peak scholarship application season (typically late fall through mid-spring) it is recommended to log in more frequently.

I Was Awarded a University Merit Scholarship Through Admissions&period; Am I Eligible for ScholarshipUniverse Scholarships&comma; Too&quest;

Yes! You can receive as many scholarships for which you qualify. The only limitation is that your total scholarship and grant assistance (from all sources) cannot exceed your cost of attendance. Also, if you are receiving a scholarship from the University, it can only be applied towards direct costs – tuition, University fees, room and meals on campus. If those costs are covered by other forms of gift aid (grants, external and internal scholarships and waivers), your University scholarship will be reduced.

How Do Outside Scholarships Impact My Current Financial Aid&quest;

Outside scholarships from all sources are considered aid. The total of your financial aid cannot exceed your [Cost of Attendance](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/financial-aid/cost-of-attendance/). Funds received may result in a reduction or cancellation of your student loans or institutional grants. There may also be a reduction in your Garden State Guarantee grant based on the state regulations which limit this funding.

I Was Awarded a Scholarship Through ScholarshipUniverse&excl; Do I Have to Take Any Steps to Make Sure the Award Is Applied to My Montclair Bill&quest;

External scholarship providers will normally send scholarship proceeds directly to the University and the Office of Student Accounts will apply it to your NEST account. If you do not see these funds applied to your account within two weeks of being notified, we recommend that you reach out directly to the sponsoring organization.
