# Notification Policy

Your Montclair State email and your [**NEST**](http://nest.montclair.edu) account are our main forms of communication. All Missing Information Requests and Financial Aid Offer Notifications will be sent to your Montclair State email address and posted on your NEST.  Failure to check your Montclair State email or NEST, errors in forwarding email and returned email (from an “over quota” mail box or “unknown user” or other error message) will not excuse a student from missing announcements or deadlines.

Only document(s) required by our office will be retained in your student file. Any documents not required or requested for the processing of aid will be shredded.

Notifications will NOT be sent to parents under any circumstances. It is the student’s duty to check their e-mail and their [NEST](http://nest.montclair.edu).
