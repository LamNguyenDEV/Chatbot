# Summer Financial Aid

Students may have eligibility for summer aid based on their registration status, the amount of aid received during the academic year, (fall/spring) and available from Federal and State Programs, please review each section below for more details.

Enrollment is verified to determine aid eligibility and disbursement.

* Students registered in additional credits or for more than 8 weeks during the summer may qualify for an increase in their estimated cost of attendance (COA).
* Students registered for less than half-time are not eligible for federal student loans.

## **Important Facts**

* You must be eligible to receive grants and/or loans during the summer term.
* [Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/financial-aid/sap-regulations/satisfactory-academic-progress-sap/) will be reviewed at the end of the spring term. Students not meeting SAP will not be eligible to receive or keep financial aid during the summer term.
* Non-matriculated or visiting students are not eligible for ANY grants or federal loans. [Private Educational Loans](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/financial-aid/loans/private-educational-loans/) are the only student loan option for assistance.
* If your enrollment drops to less than half-time, your federal and some private loans will be canceled and you will be responsible for the unpaid balance. Grant funds may be reduced on cancellation.
* If you do not complete your courses, you may lose some or all of your funding and you will owe the University.
* If you are not enrolled in any summer classes, you are not eligible to receive financial aid, even if you are living on campus.
* Disbursement of aid occurs mid-June. You cannot rely on having your financial aid funds available to pay for other expenses (e.g. rent, bills, etc.) beforehand***.***

## **Federal Pell Grants**

You may be eligible to receive a Pell Grant if you have remaining eligibility:

* If you did not attend any school in the fall and attended Montclair full-time in the spring
* If you took less than 12 credits in either or both the fall and spring semester(s) at Montclair, you may have remaining Pell eligibility for summer
* Year-Round Pell is available if you are registered for at least 1 credit.

Pell Grant eligibility will be offered automatically for all students with a current year FAFSA on file. All Pell Grant funding counts toward your Pell lifetime limits.

## NJ TAG Grants

Summer tuition aid grants are available for the summer

* Must enroll for a minimum of six (6) credits
* Must have received a NJ TAG payment in the most recent fall/spring term
* Must take courses at Montclair State University
* Must be enrolled in classes required in your academic program

The amount of your actual NJ TAG grant for summer will be determined based on the number of credits you register for and funding from NJ HESAA. Summer TAG will be posted to your account automatically.

## **Summer Work Study**

* Federal Work Study is not offered during the summer sessions.

## **Federal Stafford Loans**

* You must be a matriculated student enrolled at least half-time to qualify for Federal Stafford Loans:
  + 6 credits undergraduate and teacher certification students
  + 3 credits graduate students (Master’s degree and beyond)
* You must have remaining Federal Stafford loan eligibility.
  + If you did not attend any school in the fall and/or only borrowed part of your federal loans in the spring term
  + You did not use all of your Federal Stafford loans for the academic year. For students who have used all of their Stafford loan eligibility, there are other loan types to consider:
    - Dependent undergraduate students may have a parent apply for a [Federal PLUS loan](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/financial-aid/loans/federal-parent-loans-plus/).
    - Graduate Students (Master’s degree and beyond) may apply for a [Federal Grad PLUS loan](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/paying-for-college/loans/graduate-federal-plus-loans/).
* You must complete and submit the [Summer Loan Request Form](https://goo.gl/forms/8xpAaAAgbdmTazIE2) – you must have [Google Apps Activated](http://www.montclair.edu/oit/documentation/google-apps/) on your Montclair State account.

Should you enroll in less than half-time credits for the summer term, your loans will not disburse and be canceled.
