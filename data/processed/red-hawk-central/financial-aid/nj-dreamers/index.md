# New Jersey Dreamers

In May 2018, Governor Phil Murphy [signed legislation](https://legiscan.com/NJ/text/S699/2018) granting eligible undocumented students access to NJ State Financial Aid. This bill expands upon the New Jersey Tuition Equality Act, also referred to as the “New Jersey Dream Act” to provide NJ Grants and Scholarships to make college more affordable.

## **Eligibility Requirements for DREAMers:**

* Attended a New Jersey high school for three full years or more;
* Graduated from a New Jersey high school or received the equivalent of a high school diploma in New Jersey;
* Be an entering student or currently enrolled in an accredited New Jersey College or University;
* File an [affidavit](http://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2025/04/NJ-Affidavit-Revised-4.8.25.pdf) each year with the institution of higher education stating that the student has filed an application to legalize the student’s immigration status or will file an application as soon as the student is eligible to do so.
* To receive state aid, you must be enrolled full-time at a four-year institution or at least half time at a two-year institution.
