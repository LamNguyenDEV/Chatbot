# New Jersey Dream Act

On December 20, 2013, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed into law Senate Bill 2479 referred to as the New Jersey Dream Act.

The Law, now in effect, allows undocumented students who meet certain criteria to qualify for the in-state tuition rates at all of New Jerseyâ€™s public institutions of higher education.

If you would like to apply for in-state tuition under the Dream Act, please print and complete the [Montclair State University In-State Tuition Request Affidavit](http://www.montclair.edu/immigration-daca/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/08/NJ-Affidavit-Revised-8.3.23.pdf).

Completed forms should be mailed to:
