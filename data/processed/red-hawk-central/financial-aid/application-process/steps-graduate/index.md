# Steps to Student Financial Aid – Graduate

Step 1

Apply for Admission

If you wish to be considered for a graduate assistantship, indicate that on your graduate admissions application.

Step 2

Apply for Financial Aid

Make sure you are admitted into a [degree seeking program or an eligible certificate or certification program](http://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/paying-for-college/application-process/steps-graduate/eligible-graduate-programs/).

Create or recover your [FSA ID](https://fsaid.ed.gov/npas/index.htm). You will need this username and password to apply for federal financial aid.

File the [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/) online.

* Montclair State University School Code is **002617**

***Students must be enrolled at least half-time to receive federal aid.***

* Graduate students who are completing a master’s degree and above must take a minimum of three credits to be considered half-time.
* Teacher Certification students must take a minimum of six credits to be considered half-time.

Step 3

Review Your Financial Aid Notifications

* You will receive a notice to review your Financial Aid on [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest/).
  + Information regarding this account will be provided to you in your Admissions acceptance letter.
* You are always offered the MAXIMUM awards allowable based on the FAFSA and **full-time enrollment (six or more credits).**
  + Most graduate students are eligible for $20,500 in unsubsidized Direct Stafford student loan funds.
  + Offered aid is estimated and subject to change if your enrollment falls below full time and/or your eligibility changes.
* You cannot receive more aid than your total Cost of Attendance (direct and indirect expenses).
* If you are interested in scholarship opportunities, please visit the [Graduate School](http://www.montclair.edu/graduate/) website.

Step 4

Estimate Your Costs

The estimated fall/spring costs provided by the Financial Aid Office are known as the Estimated Cost of Attendance. The Estimated Cost of Attendance *ESTIMATES* charges for tuition and fees (direct expenses) and also includes out-of-pocket expenses like books and supplies, transportation and miscellaneous expenses for two semesters (indirect expenses).

Your bill on [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest/) will represent Actual Charges (direct costs) for each semester (tuition, fees, room and board, *if applicable)*and transfer of excess funds to Red Hawk Dollars.

Step 5

Make a Plan to Pay Your Bill

* You are responsible for any outstanding balance that is not covered by your loans by the payment deadline (indicated on the billing statement on [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest/) or see the [Payment Deadlines](/red-hawk-central/student-accounts/payment-deadlines/) page.
* You may utilize the payment plan offered by Student Accounts: [Payment Plan](/red-hawk-central/student-accounts/tuition-payment-plan/) details.
* Students in graduate degree programs can borrow additional funds from:
  + Graduate PLUS Loan Program – see [GRAD PLUS](/red-hawk-central/financial-aid/loans/graduate-federal-plus-loans/) details.
  + Private Educational Loan Program – see [Private Educational Loan](/red-hawk-central/financial-aid/loans/private-educational-loans/) details.
    - Both these loan options require a credit worthy borrower/cosigner to be approved.
* If you are interested in scholarship opportunities, please visit the [Graduate School](http://www.montclair.edu/graduate/) website and [ScholarshipUniverse](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/financial-aid/scholarships/scholarshipuniverse/).
* Do NOT rely on your aid to be available to pay rent or other bills early in the semester.

**Financial aid is not credited/deducted from the bill until after the 10th day of classes and your professors have confirmed you have attended class.**

**Refunds will be processed after the money has been credited to your student account.**

Step 6

Accept&comma; Reduce or Decline Loan&lpar;s&rpar;

* You must accept your loan(s) on [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest/) by clicking on the **“FAFSA”** page.
* You may accept the full amount or reduce the amount needed per semester on [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest/).

Step 7

Complete Direct Loan Counseling and Master Promissory Notes

**These are for your Stafford and Graduate PLUS loans**

* Log on to the [Student Loans](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action) website and complete the requirements for your loans (recommended).
  + **Complete the Entrance Counseling**
    - There is separate entrance counseling for the Stafford loan and the Graduate PLUS loan (if approved).
  + **Complete the Master Promissory Note**
    - There are separate Master Promissory Notes for the Stafford loan and the Graduate PLUS loan (if approved).
* Your federal loans will not disburse to your account until all of these requirements are completed and this information has posted to our system (can take 7-10 days).

Step 8

* Check [NEST](http://www.montclair.edu/nest) regularly for financial aid, billing, registration and other information.
