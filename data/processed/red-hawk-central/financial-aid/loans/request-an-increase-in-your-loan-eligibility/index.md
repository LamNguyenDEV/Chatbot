# Request an Increase in Your Loan Eligibility

*Increases can only be made up to the yearly amount allowable for you by Federal regulation.*

1. All financial aid is for a 9-month/30-week academic year, based on enrollment. Adjustments to this standard may be made by the Financial Aid Loan team if youâ€™re also enrolled in the Summer term.
2. You must submit a request in writing and list all expenses for the 30-week period.These expenses are compared to the current allowances to determine if a budget increase can be justified.
3. Certain expenses are not permissible (e.g. pay off credit cards, car payments).

If you would like to increase your loan eligibility, please complete the [COA Re-evaluation Form](https://www.montclair.edu/red-hawk-central/forms/) and submit it to the Financial Aid Office.

The Financial Aid Office may revise your Cost of Attendance to reflect actual charges to account for institutional aid (e.g. RA Waivers, etc.) and/or to maximize aid eligibility.
