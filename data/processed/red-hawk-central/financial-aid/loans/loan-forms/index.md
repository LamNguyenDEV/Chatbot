# Loan Forms

**PDF forms should be downloaded and completed using Adobe Acrobat Reader. This will also allow you to save the completed form for your records.**

* Fillable PDFs using Adobe allow you to complete and digitally sign forms so they can be submitted through Email as an attachment.
* There is also a “Validation” function built into the forms to ensure that you have completed all required fields.
* Using a web browser like Internet Explorer, Mozilla or Chrome may prevent the form from being signed digitally and may prevent you from saving a copy for your records.

You will need the Adobe Acrobat Reader to view and print many of the files on this page. It is available for [download](https://get.adobe.com/reader/), free of charge.

[Loan Reaffirmation Form](https://studentaid.gov/app/api/repayment-forms/download-repayment-form?searchType=library&shortName=reafrm&localeCode=en-us) – Complete this form if you are requested to complete a loan reaffirmation with your servicer, due to over-borrowing the allowable federal loan limits. Once complete you will send the form to your loan servicer that holds the over-borrowing loan *(do not send this to the school, only the loan servicer can process this request).*

Income Repayment Driven Request Form – Complete this form if you want to see if you qualify for the new income-driven repayment plan for student loan repayment.
